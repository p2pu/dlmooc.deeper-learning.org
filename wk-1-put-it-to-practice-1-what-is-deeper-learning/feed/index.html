		<description><![CDATA[I agree that students need to learn via what is relevant to them.  But I also I think they need to know things that may not be as directly interesting.  For example, while expressing yourself you may use slang and your own style, but a student should also learn and know &quot;formal&quot; writing and good grammar.  How do you balance it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although I tend to agree with the overall picture, I think we should sober up on  the hyper-relevant curriculum imperative. Abraham Flexner&#039;s &quot;The usefulness of useless knowledge&quot; would make a great counterbalancing argument. 

&quot;In The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge (PDF), originally published in the October 1939 issue of Harper’s, American educator Abraham Flexner explores this dangerous tendency to forgo pure curiosity in favor of pragmatism — in science, in education, and in human thought at large — to deliver a poignant critique of the motives encouraged in young minds, contrasting those with the drivers that motivated some of history’s most landmark discoveries.&quot;  

Upfront pragmatism (whatever its source, educ authorities, teachers or kids from the hood) may not be the best road to follow. The recipe, if there&#039;s one, needs far more ingredients eg. a dash of idleness to engage in daydreaming perhaps?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This video is very thought provoking and could lead many directions in an adult education and literacy classroom!  Many of our adult students have felt the need and relevance to earn a high school equivalency diploma to continue with formal education of some kind or get an interview/job opportunity.  This video could begin a discussion that may be a pathway to project-based learning for adult (or adolescent) learners.  We all like to have relevance to our lives when we learn, right?...sometimes we just don&#039;t see it till later on, however.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This, to me, presents a critical situation: we have an unconfident parent wanting the best and being encouraged to engage and a student confused by the reality of social media in conjunction with the demands of formal education. To me it suggests the need for LOCAL Deeper Learning (e.g., the Local Education Communities or LECs [http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/finding_common_ground/2013/02/local_education_communities.html] in conjunction with the individual Considerations [http://johncbennettjr.com] to support the Deeper Learning of all students.]]></description>
