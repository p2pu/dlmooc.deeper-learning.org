		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for introducing Genius Hour to the G+ Community.  There are so many nuggets of classroom wisdom from you and your students.  I don&#039;t know when you find the time to read all of these great books full of effective ideas, but I appreciate that now I too can benefit.  It actually seems like an efficient and purposeful use of time for our Advisory program.  Often times Advisory tends to be the last class teachers remember to plan for at our school, so it can deteriorate into Starbucks runs or &quot;work time&quot;.  Whereas Genius Hour would be a legitimate and fruitful way to approach personal development!]]></description>
