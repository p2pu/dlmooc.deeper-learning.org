		<description><![CDATA[I tried the writing task that allowed students to write what was in their heads either good or bad. I found most students were keen to write what was happening in their lives outside of school. A lot of the writing was based around out of school activities particularly for the boys but some of the writing was around personal issues that would be playing on students minds. It was a worthwhile activity that I will definitely repeat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At my school we do the &#039;class meetings&#039; on a regular basis and find they are great for helping the class to connect with each other and to celebrate the good and not so good day to day events. 
On Friday I did the highlights of the week but hadn&#039;t thought of he lowlights. I&#039;ll give this a go as I think it is a great idea. The other idea I want to try is the &#039;lunchtime love&#039; as I think this is a great way to get to know our students in an informal way. Lots of great ideas to try out here]]></description>
