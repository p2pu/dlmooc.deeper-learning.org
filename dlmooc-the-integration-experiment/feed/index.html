Thanks for sharing the Minecraft video. I&#039;m listening and hearing such a good sense of framing of learning.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback, Verena.  I have felt the sense that this learning is &quot;bigger than just one person.&quot;  If only you could have seen use six months ago!  Most of us had never used Twitter and were just trying to figure out how to use our new Chromebooks.  We have learned so much in the IT&amp;DML program.  This semester has been a tipping point for me.  I am finally using Twitter and my PLN to really learn, not just to complete assignments.  I&#039;m more comfortable interacting online and am excited about all the learning.  Thanks to you and Ian for leading us to this point and trusting us to follow our own paths.]]></description>
