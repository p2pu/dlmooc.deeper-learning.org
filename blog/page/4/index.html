<p>Story title: Why didn&#8217;t I get an ice cream?</p>
<p>Submitted by: Simon Buckingham Shum<br />
Bushfield School, Wolverton / Open Univ. / Bristol Univ.</p>
<p>DL story: STORY CONTEXT</p>
<p>At <a href="http://bushfieldschool.net" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bushfieldschool.net']);">Bushfield School</a>, Wolverton, a multi-cultural primary school of about 300, in an area with some social deprivation, we are embedding learning dispositions and authentic inquiry methodologies into the DNA of the school in a long term programme, which started about 5 years ago: <a href="http://bushfieldschool.net/learning" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bushfieldschool.net']);">http://bushfieldschool.net/learning</a></p>
<p>We started by adopting the language for learning that has come from the University of Bristol Grad School of Education, called Learning Power, which has arrived at very similar conclusions and pedagogies to Carol Dweck&#8217;s mindsets research, and provides a self-diagnostic survey tool called ELLI which makes one’s dispositions visible: <a href="http://bushfield.wordpress.com/2012/01/07/assessing-our-learning-power" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bushfield.wordpress.com']);">http://bushfield.wordpress.com/2012/01/07/assessing-our-learning-power</a></p>
<p>Through continued work with Ruth Deakin Crick at Bristol, we have now started using a methodology called Authentic Inquiry* which gives students a lot of voice and choice about the focus of their inquiry projects, which must be on something they care about, and are run over 10 days with the whole curriculum cleared for this (apart from PE). We are trying to understand how well this works with primary age children (UK Years 5-6, aged 9-11) — e.g. how well can different ability children cope with such freedom, what scaffolds are needed, how do teachers monitor the progress of 30 different projects&#8230;?</p>
<p>A movie documenting a recent “AIP” (Authentic Inquiry Project) by Year 5, in which they all worked on a Fashion Show, is due out shortly, plus a report documenting it in detail. I’ll add links to these when they’re up. Blog posts with some photos at <a href="http://bushfield.wordpress.com/tag/aip" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bushfield.wordpress.com']);">http://bushfield.wordpress.com/tag/aip</a></p>
<p>THE STORY</p>
<p>Here’s a story illustrating just one learning journey. A Yr 6 girl, not an academic high flyer, chose as her focal object/person/place a photo of herself on the beach as a toddler. The AIP interview with her went something like this:</p>
<p>“Why did you choose this photo for your AIP?”</p>
<p>“Because it was a summer holiday at the seaside that I always looked forward to.”</p>
<p>“Who’s that in the photo?”</p>
<p>“My brother and sister.”</p>
<p>“What’s going in the photo?”</p>
<p>“Well, that day I asked mum for an ice cream, but she had said no. But then later my big brother got one, and when my little sister asked, she did too.”</p>
<p>“How did that make you feel?”</p>
<p>“Sad. Left out.”</p>
<p>“So what did you do next in your AIP then?”</p>
<p>“When I talked to my teacher about my photo, I learnt that there’s something called Middle Child Syndrome, which is all about children like me who sometimes feel left out. So then I wanted to research that.”</p>
<p>“How did you do that?”</p>
<p>“I went on the web and learnt all about it, and then I designed a questionnaire to give to other middle children in the class, and videoed them talking about it.”</p>
<p>This précis illustrates how one moves in the Authentic Inquiry methodology from a concrete object/person/place, through a process of close observation, then questioning, into bigger questions, which then begin to connect with the wider funds of knowledge out there. Staff reported that they had never seen her so engaged in her learning, and rated the impact for her (they did this for all pupils) as transformational. For others, this was not the case, especially with lower literacy levels, and those with learning difficulties, with lower self-regulation.</p>
<p>TRACKING PROGRESS IN PERSONALISED DEEP LEARNING</p>
<p>It’s a challenge to monitor the progress of 30 different AIPs in a given class. One approach we’ve trialled for 3 AIPs now is having all students blog in a period reserved for this at the end of each day. They use a specially extended version of the WordPress platform that we developed, called EnquiryBlogger: info and open source WordPress Multisite plugins: <a href="http://learningemergence.net/tools/enquiryblogger" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://learningemergence.net']);">http://learningemergence.net/tools/enquiryblogger</a>.</p>
<p>This requires pupils to add categories to their posts which reflect the dimensions of Learning Power that they feel they are evidencing in the blog. E.g. “Resilience” when things really go wrong that day; “Curiosity” when they find themselves seeking out new information; “Learning Relationships” when they found that a peer could help them.</p>
<p>The tool then aggregates a visual spidergram as feedback to them on all the learning power dimensions they have blogged about, and the teachers get a dashboard of the whole class. It’s early days yet, it’s rough at the edges, but we have some encouraging results. A talk about this including a demo and student quotes are here: <a href="http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/sbs/2012/06/enquiryblogger-seminar" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk']);">http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/sbs/2012/06/enquiryblogger-seminar</a></p>

<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6752">We publish poetry, essays, short stories and eccentric visual art that shatter the pre-established borders of artistic possibility with a fresh and novel approach. Artists from all backgrounds, from all over the world that have a particular taste for absurdity or an inner desire to express themselves unconventionally are encouraged to submit. Repentino. Magazine is for the sensitive audience with a sharp sense of artistic appreciation.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6774">In publishing Repentino., now reaching the world, students have learned the following: inventing, creating, designing a Gala to promote this publication, and creating organizational documents on Trello, Google Docs, Dropbox, Google Hangouts, and InDesign to move a project-based Initiative forward. In addition, students have created their own Google email attached to the magazine, worked through <a href="https://twitter.com/RepentinoMag" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://twitter.com']);">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://repentinomagazine.tumblr.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://repentinomagazine.tumblr.com']);">Tumblr</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ASFMexicoCity?ref=br_tf" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.facebook.com']);">Facebook</a> to promote the magazine and continue to get the word out in promoting their magazine.</p>

<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6773">The platform is being set to be a social and cultural influence on various cultures, to obtaining a better understanding of the needs of other cultures, through the vehicle of a magazine. This has been stage one, establishing a permanent foundation for the magazine, and phase two will be impacting social change with various cultures once a mass population is familiar with Repentino.; ultimately using ART as the key component of communication through the above-mentioned tools will change the power of these students in the process.</p>

<p>Story title: Deeper Learning for staff and students: a multifaceted story</p>
<p>Submitted by: Simon Buckingham Shum<br />
Open U. &amp; Bristol U., UK</p>
<p>DL story: Hi all</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thoroughly enjoying tuning into this MOOC, exciting to see!</p>
<p>I thought you&#8217;d like to get a glimpse of what we&#8217;re doing in the UK, in a programme led by Ruth Deakin Crick (Grad School of Ed, Bristol University). She provides the educational research foundations, while I bring in the social learning tools and analytics. Here&#8217;s a movie of Ruth introducing her work: <a href="http://learningemergence.net/about/learning-futures-design-principles" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://learningemergence.net']);">http://learningemergence.net/about/learning-futures-design-principles</a></p>
<p>Perhaps the following story is one of the best resources to start with, told from the perspectives of an educational researcher (Ruth), a secondary Headteacher (Rebecca), a learning tech researcher (me), and two teachers (Phil + Richard): <a href="http://learningemergence.net/2013/07/17/deed-elli-ai-ci-systemic-school-learning" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://learningemergence.net']);">http://learningemergence.net/2013/07/17/deed-elli-ai-ci-systemic-school-learning</a></p>
<p>In this example, you will elements of many of the key themes in our conversations: shared language for learning, staff learning culture, student engagement, evidencing impact, and building an evidence base that connects researchers and practitioners.</p>
<p>The web survey tool for student (and staff) self-assessment of learning dispositions (what Dweck calls mindsets) may be of particular interest, since conventional assessment regimes and tools are not fit for purpose when it comes to making deeper learning qualities visible. This movie introduces the Effective Lifelong Learning Inventory (ELLI) in the broader context of analytics for deeper learning: <a href="http://learningemergence.net/2012/04/30/learning-powered-learning-analytics" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://learningemergence.net']);">http://learningemergence.net/2012/04/30/learning-powered-learning-analytics</a></p>

			<p><em>(This is a guest post from <a href="https://twitter.com/joykirr" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://twitter.com']);">Joy Kirr</a>, adapted from her blog post &#8220;<a href="http://geniushour.blogspot.com/2013/09/genius-hour-has-gotten-lot-of-attention.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://geniushour.blogspot.com']);">Genius Hour: An Avenue to Better Teaching</a>.&#8221;)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.geniushour.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.geniushour.com']);">Genius Hour </a>is a project in which students are empowered to explore their own passions. The idea is to give students time to work on projects that are important to them.</p>
<p>The idea of Genius Hour and giving student choice has really affected how I teach. I focus on CHILDREN first, and then curriculum.</p>
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img alt="" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7414/9071497283_cc939f24a5.jpg" width="500" height="375" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Denise Krebs</p></div>
<p>A big idea behind this time given to students is to show them that we value them. We think they should be learning what THEY want to learn, in addition to what we are expected to teach. This idea of letting students own their own learning and giving <a href="http://www.danpink.com/2011/07/the-genius-hour-how-60-minutes-a-week-can-electrify-your-job/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.danpink.com']);" target="_blank">60 minutes a week to &#8220;electrify your job&#8221;</a> also comes from <a href="http://www.danpink.com/books/drive/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.danpink.com']);" target="_blank">Daniel Pink&#8217;s book, <i>Drive</i></a>. Whether or not Google gives their employees 20% of their time to work on personal projects, this time can be given to children if administration is supportive of the idea.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to tell you what&#8217;s happened in my class this year, as a result of spending FORTY minutes talking about what genius is, and what it is not. We spent time discussing the seven &#8220;habitudes&#8221; of geniuses that <a href="http://www.angelamaiers.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.angelamaiers.com']);" target="_blank">Angela Maiers</a> teaches about in <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Classroom-Habitudes-Revised-Teaching-Attitudes/dp/1935542621/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342061942&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=habitudes+angela+maiers" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);" target="_blank">Classroom Habitudes</a></i>.</p>
<p>Here are some quips from my 7th graders that I&#8217;ve actually written down for a post such as this.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;These are great! We have some really creative people in this class!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;That must be his genius!!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Look at what I did &#8211; it&#8217;s genius!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;He&#8217;s got perseverance, creativity, AND imagination.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I worked on being &#8216;adaptable&#8217; yesterday after school&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Please add me to the &#8216;resident expert&#8217; list under &#8216;neat &amp; organized.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>My students are realizing what they&#8217;re skilled at, and with what skills they may need help. They have already started asking each other for help during our creative days (Dot Day being the most recent). They are relying on me less this year than any other group I&#8217;ve had, and instead going to each other. We have already started building a wonderful community of learners. I&#8217;m going to continue telling my students that they have genius in them. We all do.</p>
<p>Regarding the &#8220;20% time&#8221; we are giving students, first I have to say that I&#8217;m very fortunate to work where I do. Many teachers do not have any time to spare &#8211; to hand over to their students. Others who are allowed time for this need to make sure it ties to standards, and that students are graded on it. I have the luxury of attaching it to standards my way (see <a href="http://www.livebinders.com/play/play/924593?tabid=91e382e8-5335-b384-f0d5-d79dd8a80817" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.livebinders.com']);" target="_blank">this LiveBinder and specific plans I&#8217;m using in 7th grade ELA</a>), but I am also allowed leeway on how to use the rest of our time during the week. Here is a list of how, by implementing Genius Hour ideas in my classes, the concepts have seeped into the other 80% of our time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Students can choose where (and how) to sit, as long as it&#8217;s safe and not distracting to them or others.<br />
Students can write in response to a prompt of their choice, as long as they write in relation to our goal or focus for the day.<br />
Students decorate the room. Many put up their own ideas made at home.<br />
There is no teacher desk. It is converted into a student station, with supplies for students to use whenever they have a need. (They can also sit there!)<br />
The only front of the room is when we have the projector on. The rest of the room is fair game for where the speaker (me or a student) stands. (I&#8217;m actually always on the move.)<br />
Student passions are used as catalysts for discussions or writing, or reading, or&#8230;<br />
Students give book talks.<br />
Students read what they choose.<br />
Students take pictures for our movie updates for parents.<br />
Students have blogs for authentic purposes &#8211; not for grades.<br />
Students are asked, &#8220;Why not?&#8221; more often than they hear the word, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p> I am no longer the &#8220;sage on the stage.&#8221; I am truly the &#8220;guide on the side&#8221; for most of our lessons. Implementing Genius Hour in my classroom has made me ask these questions (from p34 of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Driven-Classroom-The-Framework-Teaching/dp/1596671599" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);" target="_blank">The Passion-Driven Classroom</a></i>) every day: Who is in charge of learning at our school? Who does the most work in our classroom? Who does the creating, constructing, producing, performing? The answer must be: The learners.</p>
<p>Many teachers remain disconnected from their students. As Angela Maiers and Amy Sandvold share in <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Driven-Classroom-The-Framework-Teaching/dp/1596671599" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);" target="_blank">The Passion-Driven Classroom</a></i>, &#8220;96% of teachers reported that creativity should be promoted in the classroom. However, when asked which students they actually preferred to teach, teachers chose the students who were most compliant&#8221; (5). &#8220;Messy&#8221; learning, which is what Genius Hour is, and times when the learners are working the hardest, is difficult for me to see with my &#8220;old school&#8221; eyes. I like order. I appreciate quiet. &#8230; But the things I HEAR from students during these &#8220;messy&#8221; times are precious gems. They alert me to the fact that students are learning, and enjoying the process simultaneously. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. And that is how implementing Genius Hour has affected my teaching during the other 80% of the week.</p>

<p>Story title: Who are you?</p>
<p>Submitted by: Gerald Dillenbeck<br />
PermaCulture Homeschool</p>
<p>DL story: My 17-year son adroitly thinks in math and gaming universes; not so much in school and homework universes.</p>
<p>After pondering the prospect for two full years, he decided to take the risk of trying home-schooling with me, his dad, quite conveniently recently retired.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago we began our first session with a brief &#8220;Connecting&#8221; breathing exercise, some silence. Then we listed our &#8220;Intentions,&#8221; things we would intend to talk about during the next 90 minutes if that&#8217;s OK with the other.</p>
<p>Because I am facilitating, he begins with proposing to talk about, &#8220;Now what?&#8221;</p>
<p>I follow that with &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than adding another proposed topic to the list, 17-year Son waives his turn, as do I. As facilitator it follows our protocol that I now choose which of the two items on our list for this first day we take first. However, I ask him if he has a preference. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go with yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so we did. Two weeks later we are still working on that question with each other, and we have yet to respond in exactly the same way more than once; rather like a population of snowflakes, Deep Learning our shared hydrogen roots.</p>

<p>Story title: The Art of Storytelling</p>

DSST Public Schools</p>
<p>DL story: The year before last we had a professional storyteller, Angel Vigil, come to tell a few tales, go over the performance aspects of storytelling and also explain the value of stories to human culture. While the students were incredibly engaged by Angel&#8217;s stories and his passion for storytelling, the last part of the evening was an opportunity for students to tell their own stories using some of the skills that had been witnessed and shared. The vast majority of students who chose to participate were the students who usually struggle in the traditional classroom. What was beautiful about this deeper learning experience was the way they took a new skill, added their own passion and experience, and created an amazing learning experience for the entire community.</p>

			<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-77f98009-12b7-6cc7-dea1-15175d937e02">Students do not care how much you know until they know how much you care!  Below is a list of activities designed to cultivate a culture of personalization in your classroom. Please select one or more of these activities to Put it into Practice this week!  You will have a wonderful time getting to know your students on a personal level.</p>
<ol>
<li>Invite a student or youth to lead or participate in a <strong>staff meeting</strong>.</li>
<li>Have a <strong>conversation</strong> with a student about schools in general or their own education in  particular.</li>
<li><strong>About Me Cards</strong> (5 min)<br />
On the first day of school have students fill out an index card with the following information: name, birthday, worst educational experience, best educational experience, first impression of the class, what they hope to learn in your class, and three things they want you to know about them in order to ensure successful collaboration. This allows you to get a quick glimpse of your students as you begin the year.</li>
<li><strong>Class Meetings</strong> (15-60 min)<br />
Have students sit around the room in a circle and begin with recognitions. Recognitions are a time for students to recognize the positive actions of another student (not a time for “shout outs” because then it becomes a popularity contest). The teacher then introduces a topic and writes it on the board, then a student facilitates the conversation and makes sure that the group stays on topic. The topics can range from classroom issues, assignments, projects, content related issues, personal struggles, or world events. The student facilitator rotates every class meeting. The meeting can be as long or short as the teacher desires. The teacher is not involved in the conversation but is an active listener. This allows the teacher to learn about student viewpoints and interests in an informal way. It also permits students to sharpen communication skills and interact with all of their classmates.</li>
<li><strong>Dear Teacher</strong> (5 min)<br />
Have students write a quick letter about anything that is happening in their life about every two weeks. It allows them to share something with you privately and it enables you to get a quick snapshot of where they are at personally. For a class of 25 students, it only takes about 5 minutes to read their little note but the benefits can last a school year!</li>
<li><strong>Low-High</strong> (10-30 min)<br />
Each student briefly states their lowlight of the week and then their highlight of the week. This can be done in advisory or in a regular class. This allows teacher and students to get a snapshot of what is happening in everyone&#8217;s life. Students can share advice when it comes to lowlights and they can celebrate the highlights!</li>
<li><strong>Lunchtime Love</strong> (lunch period)<br />
When you feel as if there are certain students that you aren&#8217;t making a connection with, invite them to have lunch with you and try to learn more about their interests and struggles. There is something about eating with someone that can help them open up. Try to keep the number to 2-4 students.</li>
<li><strong>Personalized Planning</strong><br />
Choice is king (or queen) when you are working with teenagers or any students. Whenever possible allow flexibility in projects, assignments, books, problem sets that provide students with an opportunity to incorporate their own passions and interests in their work.</li>
<li><strong>Running Journal</strong> (5 min)<br />
Students journal through prompts related to subject matter or free writes and the teacher responds to students. This allows for one-on-one communication in an informal way.</li>
<li><strong>Student Interest Surveys</strong><br />
When all else fails, there is nothing like a simple survey to help you find out more about your students!  Create your own &#8220;personalized&#8221; survey to help you establish better relationships with your students.</li>

			<p><em>(This is a duplicate of the Feb. 6 email sent to registered participants.)</em></p>
<p>Dear DLMOOC  participant,</p>
<p>Just checking in as we are working our way through week 3 on students in the adult world (or wherever you happen to be in DLMOOC). We had a great panel discussion Monday. If you missed it, <a href="../../../live/archives/index.html#020314"  target="_blank">here’s the archive</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our next <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEEKXE5zryo" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);" target="_blank">“<strong>Lens into the Classroom</strong>” session</a> is today, <strong>Feb. 6 at 4pm Pacific </strong>(Los Angeles). We’ll be doing a consultancy protocol with teacher Randy Scherer looking at the following question: How does the school best help students derive and articulate meaning through the process of an internship experience? <a href="../../../exploring-internships-with-randy-scherer/index.html"  target="_blank">Some additional background information is available here</a>.</li>
<li>Our <strong>Tweet of the Week </strong>this week is “In your own K-12 education, when did you have a chance to experience the adult world?” Tweet your response with the hashtags #dladultworld and #dlmooc</li>
<li>We have some fun <strong>Put it Into Practice</strong> activity options this week around visiting workplaces in your community, bringing outside experts into your school, and doing this <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VYFDNtjXbSV_qeqd3zKazlzGqhsxYpwY5lB03Co5Ow0/edit#slide=id.p" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://docs.google.com']);" target="_blank">“cold call” activity</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many great conversations going on in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/109999014963590178695" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://plus.google.com']);" target="_blank">main G+ community</a>, in our <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/s/dlmooc/communities" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://plus.google.com']);" target="_blank">smaller groups</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dlmooc&amp;src=typd" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://twitter.com']);" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>. If you haven’t been a part of those, stop by and say hi!</p>
