		<description><![CDATA[You don&#039;t need to be registered in order to join the G+ community, but you do need to be signed into G+ with a Google account. I&#039;ll follow up on email to help out with this.

PS I double-checked and you are registered for the course. Sometimes the confirmations end up in people&#039;s spam folders.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I cannot join G+ community.  I received a message when I clicked JOIN saying that I wasn&#039;t allowed to use G+ in this organization.  What would you suggest I do?  I also never received any confirmation that my sign up went through.  So I&#039;m not even sure if my registration was successful.  
Thank you.
