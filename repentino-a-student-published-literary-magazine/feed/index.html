		<description><![CDATA[We love the attention given to help pass the attention onto others!  We are working on a project right now, called, Sabrina Travels the World, assisting with a sign that has the word SABRINA on it and showing your part of the world.  Sabrina is a 7 year old with stage 7 cancer and any photos you could share to show Sabrina the world, her main wish, through your help would be amazing!  Just go to Sabina Travels the World to contribute your picture with Sabrina&#039;s name!  :)  

We have many other projects going on and we would like you to be a part of the 2013-2014 magazine, so please contribute to help others as we do too!

Thank you everyone for making art in all forms a form of communication!]]></description>
