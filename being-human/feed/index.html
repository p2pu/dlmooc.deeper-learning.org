		<description><![CDATA[Hi Syd!

Thanks for sharing!  I really love the idea of questioning what it means to be &quot;human&quot;, and I&#039;m very curious about the short story that your group read.

Also, this makes me think of project work I did when I taught 10th grade around Mary Shelley&#039;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.  I wish I had that short story you mentioned then!

Thanks again!]]></description>
