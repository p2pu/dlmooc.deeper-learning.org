		<description><![CDATA[I attempted to apply for a badge last week, loaded all sorts of info., and then found... there was no &quot;submit&quot; button (or something similar). I haven&#039;t heard back from anyone, so I suspect I didn&#039;t do this right. Suggestions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoy the videos. I appreciate the one on displaying students&#039; work. At first I would just display the &quot;so called&#039; good pieces and &#039;boxed&#039; the others. I now display most  of my students and the ones who usually do not show any signs of learning are now trying to complete their work because they they want it to go on the display board. this is very motivating to them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for putting this Deeper Learning MOOC together for all of us. This has given me an opportunity to share laterally with educators in Otago, New Zealand as well as sharing ideas with my own staff. I thought your Week 6 Academic Mindsets and Student Agency resources were very powerful in getting people to think about fixed versus growth mindsets and what this might look like for teachers, students, parents and leaders in our education communities. The visual was a great approach that people instantly connected to. 
I know that deeper learning and our minsets have to be our focus as we work to raise student achievement and prepare our students for their future. We all need to be &quot;open to lifelong learning&quot;. 
Thank you.]]></description>
