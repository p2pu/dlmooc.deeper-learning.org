		<description><![CDATA[Hi all! Sorry to miss the &quot;live&quot; consultancy, but have really enjoyed following this conversation. I totally agree with Carissa&#039;s caution about overplaying one&#039;s hand here (or being explicit to the point of being directive enough to elicit resistance), with Ed&#039;s clarification of the importance of explicit language to shape (our and our students&#039; and colleagues&#039;) understanding and perceptions of &quot;the situation we are in&quot; and how we can move where we want to go.  Also appreciate Rob&#039;s point about student ownership in this, and Carissa&#039;s point about teacher trust being essential.  All very well said! And Ed, you had me at Vygotsky! : )

My thing is always about context -- which I interpret broadly to include the goals, work, support, and organizational features of the learning situation. Perhaps most importantly is the work in which we are asking them to engage and to what end (the goals of the work). Students are much more likely to be in the right &quot;frame of mind&quot; to receive feedback, learn from mistakes, want to enter a community of learners, keep plugging away when they are confused, etc, in the context of trying to do meaningful work that they care about doing well. They have to see the value in either the process of learning or the end goal they are trying to reach -- and that could be value to them personally or value to a community or a larger social cause that they care about. Short of that, I think it&#039;s REALLY hard to get kids to &quot;hear&quot; these messages, even if we are properly explicit without being overly directive. If people (kids or adults) don&#039;t see value in the work or the process or the end goal, I think they won&#039;t invest the effort necessary to learn or to accomplish the goal.  Much of the educational enterprise of schools is about substituting extrinsic rewards to get kids to do work that is otherwise not meaningful.  I think we&#039;d be far better off to provide opportunities for them to do meaningful work.  There is no shortage of important stuff that needs to be done in the world, and in the context of meaningful work, we are much more likely to be eager to learn how to do it better.

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I agree that the relationship between teachers and students would have a huge impact on what teachers “can” say and what effect it has on students (and on the teacher’s influence generally).  Relationship is HUGE.
 
Just to be clear: I don’t think that ‘being explicit’ has to do with using the terms ‘fixed mindset’ and ‘growth mindset’ (though that would be one form/example of &#039;being explicit&#039;).  For me, being explicit is about using language to be clear (and deliberate) about anything (examples within student agency would be &quot;that the brain becomes more capable with effective practice&quot;, or &quot;that if we find different ways to solve a math problem we come to understand it more deeply&quot;, etc), and it doesn&#039;t have to come from adults, but it&#039;s important that the clear language is present somewhere (e.g. in the students&#039; minds, or in spoken language among peers or with the teacher...).  

Note that, taking a guess on what “the other” condition in the Berkeley study was, it sounds to me like you were being explicit in both conditions (as I define ‘being explicit’) – you were just being explicit about different things (both within academic mindsets &amp; learning strategies).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Rob and Ed! I completely agree with what you both are saying. Rob, I think the point you make about ownership is very important. Ed, the point about language is also a good one and definitely backed by cognitive science research. We actually explored that issue with a cognitive researcher at Berkeley. I don&#039;t think the data looked any different from our mindset condition where we didn&#039;t used the terms fixed and growth, but the condition may have differed in other important ways. I also wonder if it&#039;s more valuable for teachers to give students that kind of language (as opposed to some outsider, like a researcher). I would hypothesize that a certain level of trust in a teacher would be an important moderator there. A lot of the teachers that are doing work on academic mindsets are exceptional and probably establish a good amount of trust with their students. I would worry about how the message would be perceived in other classroom environments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone.  I enjoyed the conversation today (and I would have enjoyed staying on for a couple more hours… :)  thank you for the stimulating thoughts!)  And thanks Laura for facilitating – I think it was a hard task and I think you did a great job moving us along, following the protocol.
 
Thanks Carissa for sharing your thoughts on ‘being explicit’.  I agree that clarifying what we mean by “being explicit” is important, and I agree that we need to be careful not to present our messages in ways that might make students feel stigmatized.
 
Rob’s comment on student ownership and working to trigger the adolescent imperative to seek community resonates strongly.
 
Adding my two cents on what ‘being explicit’ means to me, in case it contributes to the discussion and shared learning: To me ‘being explicit’ is about having students develop and use language to understand and explain the way the world works, themselves and the situation they’re in.  It&#039;s not about using specific terms, like &#039;growth mindset&#039; or &#039;fixed mindset&#039;, but about using clear language (either mentally or in speech) to develop our understanding of ourselves and the world, our beliefs, strategies, and ability to self-monitor and reflect on what we do and how. I think language is necessary to generate deep learning of anything.
 
To take a sports analogy, the equivalent of not being explicit in sports would be to tell kids to go out and play (say soccer) and learn by playing, without anyone using any language, internal/mental or inter-personal/speech.  Kids would not learn nearly as much as if language is used (either by adults or by the students themselves, and either internally or inter-personally), to label, make sense of what is happening, and explain to themselves what we’re concluding and learning.  For example, language is useful when explaining (to ourselves or to one another) that we may be planting our left foot too far from the ball… or that the next thing I’m going to practice is putting top-spin on the ball to go over the wall until I get the ball movement I want.  Or language is useful when we go back to the locker room and we view and discuss the game, and label “being under pressure on the left side of the field” and how we’ll react to that next time, or “leaving a person unmarked” and “needing to come back to cover for our teammate who is being pulled away.”  Without being explicit about what is happening and what we’re learning from that, learning doesn’t take place or is not deep or doesn’t consolidate.
 
So for me, being explicit is about making sense of experiences with language, whether it comes from students or from adults (and we need to be careful, if it’s coming from adults, to not come across as preachy or imposing, etc.).  But I think that as adults we have a responsibility to ensure that students have structures, resources, and supports needed to develop and use the language needed to acquire that deeper understanding.  Examples of language students can develop in academic mindsets and student agency would be for students to identify what makes for deliberate practice needed to master a skill, or listen to Michael Jordan speak about what he thinks is the role of mistakes, or to learn what ‘acting defensively’ means when receiving feedback and how we can prevent ourselves from acting defensively when receiving feedback.  Or about what working in the zone of proximal development is and why it’s important, or being able to explain how the brain grows more capable, or what to do when we’re confused...  etc. etc. etc.   It’s about students having and using language to make sense of the world and explain to themselves what they’re learning and concluding. That allows them to better self-monitor, self-manage, and respond to different situations.
 
In other words, “language mediates learning”.  Here’s a related text from wikipedia: &quot;Perhaps Vygotsky&#039;s most important contribution concerns the inter-relationship of language development and thought. This concept, explored in Vygotsky&#039;s book Thought and Language, establishes the explicit and profound connection between speech (both silent inner speech and oral language), and the development of mental concepts and cognitive awareness.&quot;(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky)
 
Without language, learning is really, really hard (whether it is learning about our beliefs, strategies, content, 21st century skills, or anything else).
 
I hope that contributes to the conversation and ideas.   I look forward to further discussion and shared learning.
 
Cheers,
Ed]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Carissa,
Interesting quote form Yeager and Walton. The key issue is ownership. If, as a student, I see myself as merely doing what the teacher wants, then it&#039;s the teacher&#039;s work, not mine. Too much amplification of the message triggers the adolescent imperative to resist. Instead, we want to trigger the adolescent imperative to seek community. Indeed, a light touch is required to convey the idea that one enters the community of learners by acquiring and exercising these mindsets.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi all,

Thanks again for a great conversation today! I wanted to follow up on the idea of being explicit with students. I completely agree that it&#039;s important for students to understand why we are implementing certain practices (e.g., to grow our math abilities, to strengthen our ability to persevere in the future), but I think we should be careful to clarify what we mean by &quot;being explicit.&quot; Carol Dweck, Greg Walton, David Yeager, and many other members of our team have talked on many occasions about being careful not to present our messages in ways that might make students feel stigmatized or make them feel like we&#039;re trying to convince them to think in a certain way. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessarily bad to label the mindsets or talk about them, but I think that kind of approach takes careful crafting. I think figuring out how explicit we can be is a tough and important psychological question. 

I&#039;m really curious to think more about this question of being explicit and to test it in future programs. Thanks for the stimulating conversations! I am learning a great deal from being a part of this group! I certainly see the value in getting students to think about their own learning and mindsets. Anecdotally, when I&#039;ve seen this approach, it felt very powerful. I&#039;d love to discuss good and bad ways of being explicit to clarify this point. I would love to learn more about how this works in the classroom and understand the strategies that teachers find most useful/powerful. Please share your stories!

And here is a relevant quote from Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011:
&quot;It would be reasonable to think, for example, that training teachers (or parents) to reinforce psychological messages or doubling the length of an in-class growth mindset workshop from 8 to 16 sessions would amplify an intervention’s benefits. However, if adolescents perceive a teacher’s reinforcement of a psychological idea as conveying that they are seen as in need of help, teacher training or an extended workshop could undo the effects of the intervention, not increase its benefits....... In this way, the teaching of academic content in school is fundamentally different from the delivery of psychological interventions. Academic content is complex and taught layer on layer: The more math students are taught, in general the more math they learn. Changing students’ psychology, by contrast, sometimes requires a lighter touch.&quot;

*Note: Rob and Ed provided some excellent insight on this via email that I think is really important to consider, so I hope they post it here!]]></description>

I completely agree that it&#8217;s important for students to understand why we are implementing certain practices (e.g., to grow our math abilities, to strengthen our ability to persevere in the future), but I think we should be careful to clarify what we mean by &#8220;being explicit.&#8221; Carol Dweck, Greg Walton, David Yeager, and many other members of our team have talked on many occasions about being careful not to present our messages in ways that might make students feel stigmatized or make them feel like we&#8217;re trying to convince them to think in a certain way. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessarily bad to label the mindsets or talk about them, but I think that kind of approach takes careful crafting. I think figuring out how explicit we can be is a tough and important psychological question. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m really curious to think more about this question of being explicit and to test it in future programs. Thanks for the stimulating conversations! I am learning a great deal from being a part of this group! I certainly see the value in getting students to think about their own learning and mindsets. Anecdotally, when I&#8217;ve seen this approach, it felt very powerful. I&#8217;d love to discuss good and bad ways of being explicit to clarify this point. I would love to learn more about how this works in the classroom and understand the strategies that teachers find most useful/powerful. Please share your stories!</p>
<p>And here is a relevant quote from Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011:<br />
&#8220;It would be reasonable to think, for example, that training teachers (or parents) to reinforce psychological messages or doubling the length of an in-class growth mindset workshop from 8 to 16 sessions would amplify an intervention’s benefits. However, if adolescents perceive a teacher’s reinforcement of a psychological idea as conveying that they are seen as in need of help, teacher training or an extended workshop could undo the effects of the intervention, not increase its benefits&#8230;&#8230;. In this way, the teaching of academic content in school is fundamentally different from the delivery of psychological interventions. Academic content is complex and taught layer on layer: The more math students are taught, in general the more math they learn. Changing students’ psychology, by contrast, sometimes requires a lighter touch.&#8221;</p>
<p>*Note: Rob and Ed provided some excellent insight on this via email that I think is really important to consider, so I hope they post it here!</p>
