				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We will have several suggested activities that we will invite you to participate in throughout this MOOC. Each week we will also invite participants to &#8220;put it into practice.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of deeper learning is going out and doing something. We don&#8217;t want to just talk about how much we wish other people would implement deeper learning in their practice. As John Dewey <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/42738.John_Dewey">put it</a>, &#8220;Give the pupils something to do, not something to learn; and the doing is of such a nature as to demand thinking; learning naturally results.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Each week we will have a suggestion for something you can do on your own and something you can do with others (e.g. students, colleagues).  We are trying to keep it simple but will also try to include a sample lesson plan/agenda for group activities, just to give you an idea. We know you will come up with better ideas for putting it into practice. Please share in the g+ community!</p>
<p dir="ltr">P.S. Kudos to Melissa Daniels, High Tech Middle Chula Vista, for originally coming up with the &#8220;put it into practice&#8221; name and idea.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We will have several suggested activities that we will invite you to participate in throughout this MOOC. One of these is a &#8220;tweet of the week&#8221; assignment. While we will be using the g+ community to share ideas with one another, many people not participating in DLMOOC are interacting on twitter. To encourage DLMOOC participants to share their learning with the rest of the world, we will have a suggested tweet of the week. Of note: having students present their work to an audience beyond their teacher is, in our view, part of what deeper learning is all about.</p>
<p>Happy tweeting, but don&#8217;t be a twit!</p>

<p dir="ltr">We’re excited to unveil a new video explaining what DL MOOC is all about. See below and hope you enjoy.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Thanks to Travis Sevilla for the artwork and Anna Petrick for the video editing. Also thanks to Anna for patiently coaching me through 10+ takes of this. It turns out voice acting is not in my future! Ben</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">We’re viewing this MOOC as an experiment: Can we create a deeper learning experience for a large number of people around the world in an online environment? One problem with “traditional” MOOCs is that they largely replicate the outdated “sage on the stage” model of teaching. One aspect of the course that we are going to experiment with is having a panel discussion. Now, a panel discussion (whether in person or online) can just be a series of lectures. When I went to AERA last year, I thought, “you know, four bad 15-minute lectures is still really a bad one hour lecture.” So, panel discussions are no panacea.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One image I hold in my mind is “lean back or lean forward?” We don’t want participants (and k12 students) leaning back like they are at the movies. We want them leaning forward (dare I say “leaning in”) and actively participating. So, when we broadcast a panel discussion, we want people to be able to interact with the panelists and one another so that participants are processing the conversation through dialogue and making their own meaning of the material. Not just passively receiving information.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-251"></span>During the <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/live/archives/" target="_blank">preview week</a>, while the panelists were discussing academic mindsets, they got engaged in a fascinating chat conversation, but due to the technical limitations of google hangouts, most participants weren’t able to view that conversation. We have a few ideas about how to fix this moving forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Philipp Schmidt from MIT Media Lab made a suggestion that I think is quite fascinating. At least once we are going to try recording the panel discussion ahead of time. Then, we will broadcast the panel discussion at a particular time so that participants can interact with each other while watching the panel. And, we will have the panelists also watch the recorded discussion and participate in the chat conversation with everyone else. As a panelist, it can be hard to both fully participate in a conversation and keep up with a chat conversation, so we are thinking this might be a way to allow panelists to be more fully present in each space. We will be interested in your feedback on these ideas.</p>
