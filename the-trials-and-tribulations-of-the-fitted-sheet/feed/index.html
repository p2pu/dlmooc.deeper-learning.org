		<description><![CDATA[This is a great example of how something ordinary (OK&lt; so maybe I too struggle with sheets and my time in the National Guard/military didn&#039;t help me as one would suspect) becomes something larger and expansive. It&#039;s about the lens that we look at our lives and how to make meaning out of memories.
Wonderful story.
