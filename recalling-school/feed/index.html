		<description><![CDATA[Hello Ida!

Thank you for sharing your DL moment and your thoughts around Deeper Learning as a whole...

Your brief anecdote took me back to my experiences taking a ceramics class as an adult, and the challenges of being willing to push myself in a creative way, without getting caught up in my inhibitions.  

I truly had to &quot;learn by doing&quot;, and even though my best of plans and sketches did not always come together as hoped (I am far from artistic...), I still agree that the value of the first step is so very significant.

Thanks again for sharing!]]></description>
