		<description><![CDATA[Great work!
Maybe you could also bring humanities into the project. Check this:
http://www.designboom.com/design/mobile-homeless-shelter/

About this design, I would ask students: is it a solution, or rather a patch? 
And... can we propose a patch, to attend the needs of people living in the streets, while simultaneously bringing attention to the roots of the problem?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To Brandon
I was really excited to see your project on the &quot;lens into the classroom&quot; session. At the beginning of December I visited HTH as a part of the Israeli delegation. I didn&#039;t got to see the tiny house model but I met 2 of your students at the San Diego Maker Faire. I had the chance to talk to one of them. Sadly I don&#039;t remember her name. I do remember how impressed I was from her knowledge and enthusiasm. I asked her if she had the chance to use that environmental experience in her real life. She told me about how she helped her parents calculate how much money a solar electricity system will save them. A solar electricity agent gave them the wrong impression that it will be profitable very fast and she was the only member of her family that had any idea in that specific issue. She helped her parents decide on that mater and it made her fill valuable. She also told me that in the future, when she&#039;ll have her own house she wants to have a more environmental water system. I hope that my story helps u to see student understanding of the environmental content. I know that I was impressed. Keep on the good work and thank you for sharing it with us. 
I watched the session from the archive and had a tuning thought about a social potential aspect of the project. In Israel the only people who use these environmental facilities are rich or naturalist Enthusiasts. Most of the working class struggling to survive and don’t have the time to learn and invest in the environmental new ideas even though it can eventually save money and save the world. What if instead or after building the tiny house as an example your class will help a real family to transform their house to green energy and green materials?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The project is interesting and no doubt enriched the students&#039; understanding of both tiny houses and ability to work with solar energy. The hands-on learning and research component is definitely integral to learning. Being able to see something take shape that you have envisioned and actually finish the house they had planned must have been a truly empowering experience for your students.
I have also blogged about this movement and find it a fascinating reaction to the status quo and the banking system.  Yet I find this project, in its conception, very much in keeping with the status quo, which is disheartening.  Was there no questioning of what was really primary in a dwelling space?  The kitchen counter takes up an enormous amount of space.  Where is the living area?  Perhaps the tour simply did not show this off well.  
The project does not seem to show much innovation and it certainly is possible.  The following link is a similar project which found some unusual answers to questions that must have been asked at some point during the project you worked on.  Food for thought - .http://tinyhouseblog.com/tiny-house-concept/otis-new-take-american-dream/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a wonderful project! I blogged about this concept  &amp;  when I was a librarian at ITT Technical Institute, since I thought it would make a great capstone project for our Drafting &amp; Design students. So I made this suggestion to my fellow DLMOOC librarians (1-25): My +DL Mooc activity suggestion:

&quot;Libraries have traditionally served as repositories &amp; archives. We should offer our services as connectors of both resources &amp; people.
Given the plethora of artifacts generated through PBL activities (including portfolios, videos, photos, drawings, etc.), I propose that each school librarian serve as the archivist of his/her school&#039;s artifacts. That could include developing a database with metadata, tags, contact information for teacher/project supervisor. In addition, we could encourage &#039;narration&#039; of project process, articulation of lessons learned (both &#039;how I did it well&#039; &amp; &#039;how I&#039;d do it differently&#039;). This activity might help bring continuity to an activity - allowing it to grow by being refined by future classes. What do you think of this suggestion? #librarians&quot;   

Did you work with your librarian to archive these photos, drawings, &amp; other artifacts? Especially since this project was run several times, don&#039;t you think that having an archive of project artifacts, Gantt charts, post-project reflections would &#039;enhance&#039; subsequent iterations?]]></description>
