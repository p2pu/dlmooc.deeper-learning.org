		<description><![CDATA[That is a good questions, and one I&#039;ve puzzled over a lot myself. In fact, it was the whole topic of discussion over at #rhizo14 this week: &quot;how to you enforce independence in learning?&quot;

I don&#039;t have the answer to this one. The best approach I&#039;ve come up with so far is to model it, to build a strong community, and to try to meet people where they are and to help them move along.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of my main questions - for quite a time, well before this DLMOOC - has been &quot;What about the all too frequent student who has been spoon-fed all material and assignments and now is in a PBL / Deep Learning situation where their control has to go beyond &quot;show me what you want and I&#039;ll do it&quot;??? You know, the ones who believe there&#039;s a sample to be followed for everything.

And in a MOOC (I&#039;m wondering if I might want to think about facilitating one), this student motivation / engagement / control / management is absolutely critical. But, again, too many students want the roadmap provided. I&#039;m completely sold - already - on the value potential for students actively engaged in a MOOC. But what if anything can I do to enhance their buy in???]]></description>
