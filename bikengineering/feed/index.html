		<description><![CDATA[Audience is a key component here, right, Lou? The project was aimed for the competition and not for a teacher. I&#039;m always grappling with this concept, and how to make what students do meaningful. The idea of a student creating something for an audience of one (with assessment in mind) is still a central component of our school system. It shouldn&#039;t be. Expanding opportunities is key.
