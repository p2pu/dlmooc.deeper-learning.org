		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Karen. Your article makes me think about this small group ideas translates even for school PLCs or even at the classroom level - paired with past thoughts about Critical Friends Group process. What benefits this holds as we extend our f2f learning environments with online learning environments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Karen: This is a great idea for making connections when the overall group size is too large. When there is too much information procrastination can set in, as often it is difficult to figure out what to do next due to the overwhelming volume of info.
Your post, however, was the mental nudge I needed to tie together some pedagogical concepts that I want to put in place for the school I am starting. 

Covenant Global School (www.covenantglobalschool.com) has part of its structure the goal to build a database of support and resource people (see the outer ring of the wheel on my front page) and your post made me realize that DLMOOC&#039;s are  another method to develop connections with these people!  Thanks!
Then, some other ideas clicked into place.
 I have set up a subset of the school called Connexsis Educational Services that is setting up and providing expeditions, day trips, flash leaning events, hacking events, etc for CGS students, as well as for any others who wish to participate in these outings and activities, such as:
- home schooled kids
-gifted and talented kids attending public schools or even other private schools
-even adults! 
So, now I can see that I can start developing DLMOOC&#039;s for my students as well as encouraging them to connect with other students from all sorts of other educational institutions. It can be higher ed, or same K-12; it can be local or out of province; it can be international. 
What an exciting insight for Covenant Global School.  This can be another piece the puzzle to broaden and deepen the educational experience for our students!
