			<p><em>This is a guest post from </em><em>Kathleen Cushman of <a href="http://www.whatkidscando.org" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.whatkidscando.org']);">What Kids Can Do</a>, whose most recent books are <a href="http://firesinthemind.org" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://firesinthemind.org']);">Fires in the Mind</a> and its sequel, <a href="http://motivationequation.org" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://motivationequation.org']);">The Motivation Equation</a>.</em></p>
<p>What do you do when students just <i>don’t seem that interested</i> in a subject, no matter how hard you try to draw them in?</p>
<p>I recently had an interesting discussion about that question with teachers on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsQXr2Z90GE" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">Deeper Learning MOOC</a>.  And it got me thinking back on all the times that I’ve sat down with students to draw them out on a subject . . . and felt like I had failed.</p>
<p>In researching the book <i><a href="http://firesinthemind.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://firesinthemind.org']);">Fires in the Mind</a></i>, for <a href="http://www.whatkidscando.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.whatkidscando.org']);">What Kids Can Do</a>, hundreds of youth around the country met with me to investigate the question “What does it take to get really good at something?” Typically, I’d begin our small-group sessions by asking the kids to describe something they considered themselves already very good at.</p>
<p>I began to see how thoroughly we’ve trained our students to wrap up answers neatly in a complete sentence. “What I am very good at is . . .” they would begin, and then finish with a word or two. “Math.” “Basketball.” “Drawing.”</p>
<p>“Tell me more,” I would say. And wait, while they racked their brains for the “right answer.”</p>
<p>Sometimes I would have to prompt their memories. (“Was it always that way for you?” “Did you ever try to teach someone how to do that?” “What’s hard in getting the hang of it?”) Sooner or later, they got the message: I was actually <i>really interested</i> in the details of their experience.</p>
<p><b>Then, the grammar of their explanations began to relax and come alive. They knew what they were talking about. They engaged with their subject, revealed how they thought about it, entered into a discourse with others about it, qualified their original views.</b></p>
<p>Even so, at least one student in any group would shrug and turn away as if the question had no interest. That was OK with me—perhaps it felt too risky to answer, for that person in that moment. After a bit, I’d try another way in, maybe asking their opinion on something that someone else had said. Students tend to appreciate the respect we show toward how they see things differently: “Can you tell me more . . . ?”</p>
<p>“No one can understand anything if it isn’t connected in some way to something they already know,” the cognitive scientist James E. Zull points out in his wonderful book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Changing-Brain-Enriching/dp/1579220541" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);">The Art of Changing the Brain</a></em>. “Whatever their experience, that is where they start.”</p>
<p>In my case, I was helping students to explore the science behind their own learning process.  But whatever our subject—the solar system, the French and Indian War, the Pythagorean theorem, or Moby Dick—it’s worth the time it takes to find out more about where kids are coming from. (Tip: start the conversation with a concrete example. One teacher I know starts a unit on early America by asking, “Is it okay to take land if no one is using it?”)</p>
<p>Their skills, their needs, their partial ideas, their misunderstandings—all this essential information that we need for teaching effectively will come out, if we stay away from “safe” right-or-wrong answers and instead give students a safe way to “Tell me more . . .”</p>
<p><b>Once they begin to reveal their existing connections, they will stop tuning out. They have something <i>real</i> to say—and we can build on that.</b></p>
<p>“Tell me more . . .” As we make it a part of our teaching, sooner or later we’ll hear our students say those words themselves. It’s a legacy that can guide a lifetime of intellectual and emotional engagement.</p>
<p><i>Kathleen Cushman’s new multimedia book <a href="http://motivationequation.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://motivationequation.org']);">The Motivation Equation</a> can be read free on any web browser, the iPad, and the iPhone.</i></p>

<p>Story title: I Matter: Teacher&#8217;s Passion</p>
<p>Submitted by: JoAnn Delaney<br />
Hershey Middle School</p>
<p>DL story: I matter! 2 simple words that I was inspired to have my students chant from their heart after hearing Angela Maiers!</p>
<p>I matter! 2 simple words I wanted my students to feel as they lived their passion during Genius Hour.</p>
<p>I matter! 2 simple words that students beamed as they changed the world in their own special way.</p>
<p>Today, as I &#8220;Think Outside The Storm,&#8221; the teacher is called on to share her passion.</p>
<p>My passion is having a profound world changing impact on every student! As I feverishly posted Vine videos and posts showing the enormous power children hold to change the world, I found myself driven with excitement!</p>
<p>As a result of providing my students with the gift of Genius Hour, they tapped their passions and created beautiful change.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/delaney.png" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-658" alt="delaney" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/delaney.png" width="468" height="469" /></a></p>
<p>This change opened our hearts to the world, sometimes bringing great joy and other moments heart-breaking hurt.</p>
<p>Students&#8217; bravery is remarkable. Sully resiliently faced bullying and turned to bullied children to befriend them, &#8220;Speaking Life.&#8221; Kamrin rallied her friends and neighbors to collect items sent to Gambia, Africa! Dani, Emma and Jaelissa use their amazing voices to sing &#8220;Beautiful,&#8221; encouraging girls to find their beauty within. Charlotte loves animals so much that she collected and delivered needed items to the Humane Society. Makenzie created crayon dripped art for a hospitalized child and shared the message that anything is possible; believe in yourself! Alexa emotionally moved by a family member&#8217;s breast cancer, raised money to end the disease. Rachel made bracelets and delivered them to sick children at the hospital. Ainsley created homemade cards and gift baskets to deliver to the elderly. My students&#8217; passionate gifts abound! I am humbled by their genius.</p>
<p>As a passionate educator my enthusiasm created possibility. These student actions began with an I wonder question, genuine interest and/or deep passion. The change of one affects many leading to powerful world change.</p>
<p>I believe that the smartest person in the world is the world! It starts with 1 passionate person and grows exponentially to world compassion.</p>
<p>I matter! I am genius! I am genius and the world needs my contribution!</p>
<p>We matter! We are genius! We are genius and together can change the world with our contributions!</p>
<p>Going back to the original questions that led to this blog post, What’s your passion, and what drives it? What’s your heartbreak? How will you use your genius to change the world?</p>
<p>I ask you, have I used my genius to change the world?</p>

<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6752">Launched in Mexico City, the international magazine <a href="http://repentinomagazine.tumblr.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://repentinomagazine.tumblr.com']);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Repentino</a>. was created by young intellectuals of the American School Foundation for the sole purpose of igniting a love for the arts.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6752"> <a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-12-at-9.13.19-PM.png" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-651" alt="Repentino. cover" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-12-at-9.13.19-PM.png" width="394" height="487" /></a></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6752">We publish poetry, essays, short stories and eccentric visual art that shatter the pre-established borders of artistic possibility with a fresh and novel approach. Artists from all backgrounds, from all over the world that have a particular taste for absurdity or an inner desire to express themselves unconventionally are encouraged to submit. Repentino. Magazine is for the sensitive audience with a sharp sense of artistic appreciation.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6774">In publishing Repentino., now reaching the world, students have learned the following: inventing, creating, designing a Gala to promote this publication, and creating organizational documents on Trello, Google Docs, Dropbox, Google Hangouts, and InDesign to move a project-based Initiative forward. In addition, students have created their own Google email attached to the magazine, worked through <a href="https://twitter.com/RepentinoMag" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://twitter.com']);">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://repentinomagazine.tumblr.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://repentinomagazine.tumblr.com']);">Tumblr</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ASFMexicoCity?ref=br_tf" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.facebook.com']);">Facebook</a> to promote the magazine and continue to get the word out in promoting their magazine.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6774">In helping support <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SmallArtSchool" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.facebook.com']);">The Cambodia Small School,</a> The Repentino. magazine hopes to become an advocate of community and world service, branching out the purpose of their campus magazine.  Staff are realizing it takes a village to change the world, and hope to spread the world of what Repentino. has become, and will become, thanks to the many contributors.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6773">The platform is being set to be a social and cultural influence on various cultures, to obtaining a better understanding of the needs of other cultures, through the vehicle of a magazine. This has been stage one, establishing a permanent foundation for the magazine, and phase two will be impacting social change with various cultures once a mass population is familiar with Repentino.; ultimately using ART as the key component of communication through the above-mentioned tools will change the power of these students in the process.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6776">Here is a video we put together for the <a id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6775" href="http://k12onlineconference.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://k12onlineconference.org']);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K12 Online Conference</a>, which includes several of our students talking about this project:</p>

			<p><em>(This is a guest post from <a href="https://twitter.com/joykirr" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://twitter.com']);">Joy Kirr</a>, adapted from her blog post &#8220;<a href="http://geniushour.blogspot.com/2013/09/genius-hour-has-gotten-lot-of-attention.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://geniushour.blogspot.com']);">Genius Hour: An Avenue to Better Teaching</a>.&#8221;)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.geniushour.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.geniushour.com']);">Genius Hour </a>is a project in which students are empowered to explore their own passions. The idea is to give students time to work on projects that are important to them.</p>
<p>The idea of Genius Hour and giving student choice has really affected how I teach. I focus on CHILDREN first, and then curriculum.</p>
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img alt="" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7414/9071497283_cc939f24a5.jpg" width="500" height="375" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Denise Krebs</p></div>
<p>A big idea behind this time given to students is to show them that we value them. We think they should be learning what THEY want to learn, in addition to what we are expected to teach. This idea of letting students own their own learning and giving <a href="http://www.danpink.com/2011/07/the-genius-hour-how-60-minutes-a-week-can-electrify-your-job/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.danpink.com']);" target="_blank">60 minutes a week to &#8220;electrify your job&#8221;</a> also comes from <a href="http://www.danpink.com/books/drive/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.danpink.com']);" target="_blank">Daniel Pink&#8217;s book, <i>Drive</i></a>. Whether or not Google gives their employees 20% of their time to work on personal projects, this time can be given to children if administration is supportive of the idea.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to tell you what&#8217;s happened in my class this year, as a result of spending FORTY minutes talking about what genius is, and what it is not. We spent time discussing the seven &#8220;habitudes&#8221; of geniuses that <a href="http://www.angelamaiers.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.angelamaiers.com']);" target="_blank">Angela Maiers</a> teaches about in <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Classroom-Habitudes-Revised-Teaching-Attitudes/dp/1935542621/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342061942&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=habitudes+angela+maiers" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);" target="_blank">Classroom Habitudes</a></i>.</p>
<p>Here are some quips from my 7th graders that I&#8217;ve actually written down for a post such as this.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;These are great! We have some really creative people in this class!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;That must be his genius!!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Look at what I did &#8211; it&#8217;s genius!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;He&#8217;s got perseverance, creativity, AND imagination.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I worked on being &#8216;adaptable&#8217; yesterday after school&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Please add me to the &#8216;resident expert&#8217; list under &#8216;neat &amp; organized.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>My students are realizing what they&#8217;re skilled at, and with what skills they may need help. They have already started asking each other for help during our creative days (Dot Day being the most recent). They are relying on me less this year than any other group I&#8217;ve had, and instead going to each other. We have already started building a wonderful community of learners. I&#8217;m going to continue telling my students that they have genius in them. We all do.</p>
<p>Regarding the &#8220;20% time&#8221; we are giving students, first I have to say that I&#8217;m very fortunate to work where I do. Many teachers do not have any time to spare &#8211; to hand over to their students. Others who are allowed time for this need to make sure it ties to standards, and that students are graded on it. I have the luxury of attaching it to standards my way (see <a href="http://www.livebinders.com/play/play/924593?tabid=91e382e8-5335-b384-f0d5-d79dd8a80817" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.livebinders.com']);" target="_blank">this LiveBinder and specific plans I&#8217;m using in 7th grade ELA</a>), but I am also allowed leeway on how to use the rest of our time during the week. Here is a list of how, by implementing Genius Hour ideas in my classes, the concepts have seeped into the other 80% of our time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Students can choose where (and how) to sit, as long as it&#8217;s safe and not distracting to them or others.<br />
Students can write in response to a prompt of their choice, as long as they write in relation to our goal or focus for the day.<br />
Students decorate the room. Many put up their own ideas made at home.<br />
There is no teacher desk. It is converted into a student station, with supplies for students to use whenever they have a need. (They can also sit there!)<br />
The only front of the room is when we have the projector on. The rest of the room is fair game for where the speaker (me or a student) stands. (I&#8217;m actually always on the move.)<br />
Student passions are used as catalysts for discussions or writing, or reading, or&#8230;<br />
Students give book talks.<br />
Students read what they choose.<br />
Students take pictures for our movie updates for parents.<br />
Students have blogs for authentic purposes &#8211; not for grades.<br />
Students are asked, &#8220;Why not?&#8221; more often than they hear the word, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p> I am no longer the &#8220;sage on the stage.&#8221; I am truly the &#8220;guide on the side&#8221; for most of our lessons. Implementing Genius Hour in my classroom has made me ask these questions (from p34 of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Driven-Classroom-The-Framework-Teaching/dp/1596671599" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);" target="_blank">The Passion-Driven Classroom</a></i>) every day: Who is in charge of learning at our school? Who does the most work in our classroom? Who does the creating, constructing, producing, performing? The answer must be: The learners.</p>
<p>Many teachers remain disconnected from their students. As Angela Maiers and Amy Sandvold share in <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Driven-Classroom-The-Framework-Teaching/dp/1596671599" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);" target="_blank">The Passion-Driven Classroom</a></i>, &#8220;96% of teachers reported that creativity should be promoted in the classroom. However, when asked which students they actually preferred to teach, teachers chose the students who were most compliant&#8221; (5). &#8220;Messy&#8221; learning, which is what Genius Hour is, and times when the learners are working the hardest, is difficult for me to see with my &#8220;old school&#8221; eyes. I like order. I appreciate quiet. &#8230; But the things I HEAR from students during these &#8220;messy&#8221; times are precious gems. They alert me to the fact that students are learning, and enjoying the process simultaneously. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. And that is how implementing Genius Hour has affected my teaching during the other 80% of the week.</p>

			<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-77f98009-12b7-6cc7-dea1-15175d937e02">Students do not care how much you know until they know how much you care!  Below is a list of activities designed to cultivate a culture of personalization in your classroom. Please select one or more of these activities to Put it into Practice this week!  You will have a wonderful time getting to know your students on a personal level.</p>
<ol>
<li>Invite a student or youth to lead or participate in a <strong>staff meeting</strong>.</li>
<li>Have a <strong>conversation</strong> with a student about schools in general or their own education in  particular.</li>
<li><strong>About Me Cards</strong> (5 min)<br />
On the first day of school have students fill out an index card with the following information: name, birthday, worst educational experience, best educational experience, first impression of the class, what they hope to learn in your class, and three things they want you to know about them in order to ensure successful collaboration. This allows you to get a quick glimpse of your students as you begin the year.</li>
<li><strong>Class Meetings</strong> (15-60 min)<br />
Have students sit around the room in a circle and begin with recognitions. Recognitions are a time for students to recognize the positive actions of another student (not a time for “shout outs” because then it becomes a popularity contest). The teacher then introduces a topic and writes it on the board, then a student facilitates the conversation and makes sure that the group stays on topic. The topics can range from classroom issues, assignments, projects, content related issues, personal struggles, or world events. The student facilitator rotates every class meeting. The meeting can be as long or short as the teacher desires. The teacher is not involved in the conversation but is an active listener. This allows the teacher to learn about student viewpoints and interests in an informal way. It also permits students to sharpen communication skills and interact with all of their classmates.</li>
<li><strong>Dear Teacher</strong> (5 min)<br />
Have students write a quick letter about anything that is happening in their life about every two weeks. It allows them to share something with you privately and it enables you to get a quick snapshot of where they are at personally. For a class of 25 students, it only takes about 5 minutes to read their little note but the benefits can last a school year!</li>
<li><strong>Low-High</strong> (10-30 min)<br />
Each student briefly states their lowlight of the week and then their highlight of the week. This can be done in advisory or in a regular class. This allows teacher and students to get a snapshot of what is happening in everyone&#8217;s life. Students can share advice when it comes to lowlights and they can celebrate the highlights!</li>
<li><strong>Lunchtime Love</strong> (lunch period)<br />
When you feel as if there are certain students that you aren&#8217;t making a connection with, invite them to have lunch with you and try to learn more about their interests and struggles. There is something about eating with someone that can help them open up. Try to keep the number to 2-4 students.</li>
<li><strong>Personalized Planning</strong><br />
Choice is king (or queen) when you are working with teenagers or any students. Whenever possible allow flexibility in projects, assignments, books, problem sets that provide students with an opportunity to incorporate their own passions and interests in their work.</li>
<li><strong>Running Journal</strong> (5 min)<br />
Students journal through prompts related to subject matter or free writes and the teacher responds to students. This allows for one-on-one communication in an informal way.</li>
<li><strong>Student Interest Surveys</strong><br />
When all else fails, there is nothing like a simple survey to help you find out more about your students!  Create your own &#8220;personalized&#8221; survey to help you establish better relationships with your students.</li>
