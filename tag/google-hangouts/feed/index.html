				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a guest post from <a href="https://twitter.com/@verenanz">Verena Roberts</a>, open, blended, and elearning changemaker extraordinaire.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid--9972e88-571d-8475-91cd-2edcbfa14a7f">My name is Verena Roberts, and I am co-facilitating the ED722 Emerging Trends and Issues in Online Education course with <a href="https://twitter.com/wiobyrne">Dr. Ian O’Byrne</a> from the University of New Haven.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> In an attempt to experience the current trends in online learning, we asked the #ITDML (Instructional Technologies and Digital Media Literacy) Cohort to participate in the #DLMOOC in addition to their regular, traditional weekly course work.  In preparation for this work, we learned about the history of online and distance learning, MOOCs and a quick overview of learning theories like behaviourism, constructivism and connectivism. Instead of weekly blog posts, we have integrated<a href="https://storify.com/"> Storify stories </a>and blog posts. Storify ensures that the students were able to integrate digital artifacts and examples from social media, any digital interactions with learners outside the cohort, course resources and materials and any other digital resources that demonstrate evidence of learning. The Storifies are created individually and we encourage the students to develop their online identity through their Storifies and blog posts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We were given the #DLMOOC course outline ahead of time, and we were able to try and integrate course weekly themes with the #DLMOOC themes. While #DLMOOC ends the week of March 17, our students will have 2 more weeks of their traditional scheduled course.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This week’s #DLMOOC topic is about Deeper learning for a wide range of students. I had to write a special blog post to celebrate the work, risk taking, obvious evidence of learning and dedication of the #ITDML cohort. I have been a lurker in this course. However, I have not lurked through the #DLMOOC hashtag on twitter and Google+, instead, I have lurked and learned through the summaries and reflections of the #ITDML cohort students. I have learned more from my students &#8211; with my students, than I thought possible. We are learners together!</p>
<p dir="ltr">We decided to ask students to choose their own synchronous webinars and Hangouts during the week.  Include their learning and synchronous choices in their weekly reflections. They are encouraged to contact us directly if they have a question.  We wanted to see, with a certain amount of scaffolding and support at the beginning of the term, and  knowing the #ITDML students had a wide variety of web literacy skills &#8211; would an “open, connected  and networked” approach to learning by experiencing it &#8211; work?</p>
<p dir="ltr">While we are NOT finished the term, and the students may disagree with me, I am floored at the transition in their blog posts and participation in learning throughout the web with a wide variety of learners. Over the last week, I started the #Gamifi-Ed project. In the #ITDML Storifies, there is evidence of learning through #DLMOOC webinars, twitter chats and online interactions, #Gamifi-ED and a wide variety of other connected online experiences that the students have found. They are not learning in isolation &#8211; and as a result, they are contributing to  what Price calls, a Global Learning Commons. They are collaborating and creating learning that is bigger than “just one person”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In conclusion I have to use the example of Gail Corbett to describe the learning I am “seeing”. Gail’s son was on a Google Hangout panel about the importance of Minecraft &#8211; as Described by Minecraft Youtubers. The “expert” youtuber on the panel was @Drakkart and he had created a video before the Hangout &#8211; as a plea for those of us who don’t “get” why Minecraft is so important. Gail was able to integrate the themes of student voice, internship, games based learning and add her plea as a parent to consider games in the classroom.</p>
<p>This is a storify that includes @Drakkart’s video, the #Gamifi-ED Hangout and Gail’s reflections. It is priceless to be part of such learning that influences so many people in so many ways.</p>
