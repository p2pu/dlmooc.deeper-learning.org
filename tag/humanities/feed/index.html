<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6752">Launched in Mexico City, the international magazine <a href="http://repentinomagazine.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Repentino</a>. was created by young intellectuals of the American School Foundation for the sole purpose of igniting a love for the arts.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6752"> <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-12-at-9.13.19-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-651" alt="Repentino. cover" src="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-12-at-9.13.19-PM.png" width="394" height="487" /></a></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6752">We publish poetry, essays, short stories and eccentric visual art that shatter the pre-established borders of artistic possibility with a fresh and novel approach. Artists from all backgrounds, from all over the world that have a particular taste for absurdity or an inner desire to express themselves unconventionally are encouraged to submit. Repentino. Magazine is for the sensitive audience with a sharp sense of artistic appreciation.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6774">In publishing Repentino., now reaching the world, students have learned the following: inventing, creating, designing a Gala to promote this publication, and creating organizational documents on Trello, Google Docs, Dropbox, Google Hangouts, and InDesign to move a project-based Initiative forward. In addition, students have created their own Google email attached to the magazine, worked through <a href="https://twitter.com/RepentinoMag">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://repentinomagazine.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ASFMexicoCity?ref=br_tf">Facebook</a> to promote the magazine and continue to get the word out in promoting their magazine.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6774">In helping support <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SmallArtSchool">The Cambodia Small School,</a> The Repentino. magazine hopes to become an advocate of community and world service, branching out the purpose of their campus magazine.  Staff are realizing it takes a village to change the world, and hope to spread the world of what Repentino. has become, and will become, thanks to the many contributors.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6773">The platform is being set to be a social and cultural influence on various cultures, to obtaining a better understanding of the needs of other cultures, through the vehicle of a magazine. This has been stage one, establishing a permanent foundation for the magazine, and phase two will be impacting social change with various cultures once a mass population is familiar with Repentino.; ultimately using ART as the key component of communication through the above-mentioned tools will change the power of these students in the process.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6776">Here is a video we put together for the <a id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6775" href="http://k12onlineconference.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K12 Online Conference</a>, which includes several of our students talking about this project:</p>

<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6778">This project brings together student voice, student choice, project based learning, and many other aspects of deeper learning.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this week’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEEKXE5zryo">“Lens into the Classroom” session, which will be on Thurs. Feb. 6 at 4pm Pacific</a> (<a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/live/archives/">archive will be posted here</a>), we’ll be doing a consultancy protocol with teacher Randy Scherer.</p>
<p><strong>Randy’s dilemma is: “How does the school best help students derive and articulate meaning through the process of an internship experience?”</strong></p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Consultancy_LASW.pdf">description of the consultancy protocol </a>we’ll be using.</p>

<p>Randy’s classes are currently working on about a month of Humanities work centered on processing and publishing the stories of internships.His current internship-centered curricula arose out of his work in the HTH GSE, which explored the relationship between school and internship.</p>
<p>Here are some resources from Randy:</p>

<p>Story title: Being Human</p>
<p>Submitted by: Syd DiChiara<br />
Nex+Gen Academy</p>
<p>DL story: We began the year in our 10th grade Humanities class by asking the question, what is unique about being human?</p>
<p>Students were immersed in all kinds of media; short stories, documentaries, essays, art, &amp; poetry.</p>
<p>One of the stories we read and discussed was Ursula LeGuin&#8217;s &#8220;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas,&#8221; a deeply open-ended short story that challenged students to think about a number of philosophical questions, none of which had an easy answer. Students ended the project with a collaborative art installment that conveyed their group&#8217;s ideas on what it means to be human.</p>
<p>It was a great start to the year because students were engaged with complex ideas and with one another in a way that set a tone for the rest of the year. Months later, in their end-of-semester reflections, many chose the &#8220;Being Human&#8221; project as the one that impacted them the most as thinkers and learners.</p>
