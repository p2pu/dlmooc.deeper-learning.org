<p>Story title: The Art of Storytelling</p>
<p>Submitted by: Jim Stephens<br />
DSST Public Schools</p>
<p>DL story: The year before last we had a professional storyteller, Angel Vigil, come to tell a few tales, go over the performance aspects of storytelling and also explain the value of stories to human culture. While the students were incredibly engaged by Angel&#8217;s stories and his passion for storytelling, the last part of the evening was an opportunity for students to tell their own stories using some of the skills that had been witnessed and shared. The vast majority of students who chose to participate were the students who usually struggle in the traditional classroom. What was beautiful about this deeper learning experience was the way they took a new skill, added their own passion and experience, and created an amazing learning experience for the entire community.</p>
