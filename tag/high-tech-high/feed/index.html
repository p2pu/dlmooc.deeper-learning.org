				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this week’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEEKXE5zryo">“Lens into the Classroom” session, which will be on Thurs. Feb. 6 at 4pm Pacific</a> (<a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/live/archives/">archive will be posted here</a>), we’ll be doing a consultancy protocol with teacher Randy Scherer.</p>
<p><strong>Randy’s dilemma is: “How does the school best help students derive and articulate meaning through the process of an internship experience?”</strong></p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Consultancy_LASW.pdf">description of the consultancy protocol </a>we’ll be using.</p>
<p><a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC07577.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-598" alt="DSC07577" src="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC07577-1024x768.jpg" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>
<p>Randy’s classes are currently working on about a month of Humanities work centered on processing and publishing the stories of internships.His current internship-centered curricula arose out of his work in the HTH GSE, which explored the relationship between school and internship.</p>
<p>Here are some resources from Randy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/a/hightechhigh.org/rlscherer/home/internship">Internships web site</a> (with assignments, schedule, etc.)</li>

<li><a href="http://ampersand.hightechhigh.org/">Ampersand: The Student Journal of School and Work</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And here is some additional background on how High Tech High views internships:<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, January 30, we&#8217;ll be doing our first &#8220;Lens into the Classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea of these sessions is to look at a real teacher&#8217;s classroom dilemma and to assemble a group of other folks to go through a tuning protocol about this, which will them be &#8220;fishbowled&#8221; through a Google Hangout. (The idea is to let a larger group watch the session and brainstorm their own ideas. We hope that this will inspire others to try using a protocol like this at their own sites. As we progress with DLMOOC, you might even want to do this yourself online via a hangout.)</p>
<p>The teacher for this week is Brandon Cohen, a 12th grade Environmental Science teacher from High Tech High. Below is a description of his dilemma and some background on the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>HTH Tiny House Project Tuning &#8211; Focusing on Student Work<br />
</strong>Brandon Cohen &#8211; 12th grade Environmental Science &#8211; bcohen AT hightechhigh DOT org</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Dilemma</strong>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">If I were to attempt this project again, what kind of student work would better enable me to see student understanding of the environmental content while not taking attention and resources away from the large final product?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Project Overview:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Tiny House Project, spanning two semesters, addressed the environmental issues stemming from common modes of consumption in the typical Californian home by designing and building a 100 square foot, fully functioning home that demonstrates how to lessen our impact through simple, smart living and alternative, green building materials.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Participating Classes:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Spring 2013 &#8211; Collaboration between Environmental Science &amp; Multimedia (Maria McTighe, teacher)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fall 2013 &#8211; Collaboration between Environmental Science &amp; Engineering (David Berggren, teacher)</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Project Was Exhibited:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>San Diego County Fair, June 8 &#8211; July 4, 2013 (Awarded Best of Show)</li>
<li>San Diego Maker Faire, December 7, 2013 (Limited to exhibition of placards)</li>
<li>HTH Schoolwide Exhibition, December 19, 2013</li>
<li>San Diego Earth Fair, April 26, 2014</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Process and Assignments:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Home Consumption Study &#8211; Students gather data and calculate the consumption of natural gas, electricity, water, and gasoline from each appliance and fixture in the home through unit conversion calculations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Home Trash Study &#8211; Students classify and weigh trash by category (recyclable, compostable, and landfill-bound)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tiny House Design &#8211; Students research and share existing, alternative housing options, propose solutions to incorporate in the Tiny House, and design their own Tiny House in SketchUp.  Then, the class votes on the design that best addresses our issues.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Solicitation of Donations &#8211; Students are divided into groups based on the 14 different systems or parts of the house.  After learning how to write a professional email and place a professional cold call, students step outside their comfort zone by seeking donations from local vendors and national manufacturers</p>
<p dir="ltr">Construction &#8211; Students construct the Tiny House under supervision of the teachers and, at times, a licensed general contractor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tiny House System Placards &#8211; Following research and design, each student creates an 8” x 10” informational placard that highlights their group’s system and how it compares to a that of a traditional home</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here is the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hthtinyhouse/our-company">project proposal </a>and <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/hightechhigh.org/hth-tiny-house-sysyems/">more information on the systems</a>.</p>

<p>Story title: BullyProof Productions: Building Community Partnerships</p>
<p>Submitted by: Azul Terronez<br />
High Tech Middle School</p>
<p>DL story: My Deeper Learning moment came last year when our school, High Tech Middle, decided that we would teach our advisory of mixed grade levels (6, 7 and 8 ) for half of the school day, for nine weeks instead of our regular content and grade level. We called it Projectopia; the purpose was to see what would happen if we taught students that we knew really well, in mixed grades, with no specific content assigned to the course? Would removing the grade level restrictions change or challenge our work and if so in what ways? Would freeing teachers from the constraints of the content area they were familiar with create more engaging work? We were inspired by a Sir Ken Robinson TED talk the year before, which was on of our impetus for challenging the way we think about school and learning.</p>
<p>At the end of Projectopia, we were to hold an exhibition of our projects and share with the world the experiment. I decided to team up with my teaching partner and his advisory with a combined group of 38 students, 2 teachers. With our team assembled we embarked on a project to make a film to support the work of the Trevor Project, an organization that provides support for LGBTQ youth who are at risk of suicide. The Trevor Project agreed be our community client and we were tasked with the task of creating a movie to launch their new medium, &#8220;Trevor Text&#8221;. We presented the challenge to the students and explained that we were going to help spread the message of anti-bullying by creating a movie staring puppets that they created by hand sewed, they were excited and engaged.</p>
<p>There were many moments that were amazing, but I was struck when the entire production team was on a school bus, filming a scene and watching the director of the film, a 6th grader, take charge and direct all of the actors. It was awesome to see the students and adults give him attention and respect, despite his age or stature. My deeper learning moment taught me that no matter how we thought about what school was or is, it can always be challenged and redefined.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[This is a guest post from <b>Isaac Jones</b>, the Director of High Tech High North County.]</em></p>
<p>High Tech High North County is a small progressive high school (550 students) in North San Diego. We are part of a larger charter school organization, comprised of 11 schools and 3 campuses.  We have a strong focus on professional development, meeting 2  - 3 times weekly as a full staff.</p>
<div>Over the next semester, we have chosen to identify two themes within the Deeper Learning MOOC that we, as a staff, will study together.  All teachers will sign up for the MOOC and then we will spend a PD cycle (3 sessions) looking in depth at one specific theme.  We will complete this PD cycle for two separate topics.  Teachers will read articles and watch sessions together, identifying specific strategies to incorporate these ideas into their classrooms.  In addition, we will encourage teachers to implement a strategy (and hopefully capture through video) over the course of the PD cycle.</div>
