<p>Story title: When It Was All Writing</p>
<p>Submitted by: Kevin Hodgson<br />
Western Massachusetts Writing Project</p>
<p>DL story: It was my first year of teaching, and like many first year teachers, I had very little clue as to what I was doing. My lifeline was the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/wmwp/">Western Massachusetts Writing Project</a> (part of the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/wmwp/">National Writing Project</a>). During that first year, I took a course through WMWP around teaching writing (I teach sixth graders) and that summer, I took part in a four-week, intensive Invitational Summer Institute with WMWP. To say it was intense would be an understatement. To say it changed my entire view as a teacher and writer would be the truth. Four weeks of writing for ourselves, of exploring the teaching of writing from many angles, of connecting with other teachers, of finding an area of expertise to share with the institute and to other teachers &#8230;. it was deep learning that took hold and never let go. What it taught me went beyond teaching, too It taught me about networks and communities (and was the first year I ever blogged, before the word &#8220;blog&#8221; even became part of the common lexicon), and of the power of being a teacher-writer who learns from other teachers and who shares with other teachers. If only all PD were that inspiring and that deep &#8230;</p>
