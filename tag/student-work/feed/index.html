				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(a post from Lou Barrios, 8th grade math and science teacher, HTMMA)</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-88067ff7-a2ff-95d1-7d38-60939406fbaa">This week’s “Put it into Practice” can be done with other teachers, with your students, or on your own.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I often struggled with what to do with the project once the students exhibited their work. The truth is that while I was really thoughtful about a lot that went on in the project, I was not nearly as thoughtful about how the project would live on.  I was moved to action after speaking to Jeff, a colleague from our high school who once told me a story that was quite piercing. He was watching a teacher from his school throw away all of his students&#8217; work the day after exhibition, and he asked why do the project if it was going to end up in the dumpster. Now, I at least have the decency to store the project in cupboards and shelves for a month or so before throwing them away.  Anyway, the point is that students should have a place to see their products after all the sweat and tears have dried. Being transparent and upfront about displaying the end product makes it so students are that much more precise about the work they are doing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jeff Robin is an Art Teacher at High Tech High who does amazing work with curating projects, and he breaks down project curating quite well <a href="http://dp.hightechhigh.org/~jrobin/curation/curation_video.html">in this video</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/75tRpQ2vr3w" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">Curating a project is not too unlike decorating a room. So, you want to add mirrors to make the room look bigger and not break the bank? Great! Just make sure when you bring them home from Ikea that they are the same color, evenly space them, level them, and they will look really nice. Symmetry, consistency and simplicity are beautiful things AND they don’t cost too much OR take too much time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I am planning on stopping by Ikea on the way home to grab <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50186500/">these $2 frames</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I like 8.5” by 11” because it’s so easy to put up student work without the hassle of cutting.  I also likes these frames because they can be held up by push pins, which makes it less difficult for students to put them up. I will go over how many frames we need per row and let my students do the measuring and spacing. It won’t be perfect; the first few times they put it up, but they will get to the point where they are all evenly spaced and level. This gives them another level of accountability and ownership over their school space and keeps this from being another thing on a busy teacher&#8217;s plate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Action Items:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a place in your classroom or school that could house student work.</li>
<li>Ask your students what work they would be most proud of hanging up.</li>
<li>Ask staff about creating a space where school-wide student work could live (sometimes 3D work needs more of a permanent space).</li>
<li>Give students ownership over how the work is displayed</li>
<li>Share some before and after pictures with the DLMOOC community through G+ or Twitter.</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-3af54e05-4c6e-e0a4-ab14-03240a6cfdaf">This MOOC has been designed to be flexible, so that you can come and go, drop out or drop in as you like. Each week’s content stands alone, so if you haven’t participated so far, it’s ok to join at any point.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And in the upcoming weeks, we have some great topics. Why not choose one that’s of interest to you, and see where you can go with it.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Week 6 starting Feb. 24 – Academic mindsets</li>
<li dir="ltr">Week 7 starting Mar. 3 – Assessment for deeper learning</li>
<li dir="ltr">Week 8 starting Mar. 10 – Exhibiting student work, audience, and curation</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning isn’t linear, and we don’t think MOOCs should be either!</p>

<p><em>This is cross-posted from <a href="http://www.domoreedu.com/guest-bloggers/blog-by-joann-delaney">JoAnn&#8217;s blog at DoMoreEdu</a>.</em></p>
<p>Story title: I Matter: Teacher&#8217;s Passion</p>
<p>Submitted by: JoAnn Delaney<br />
Hershey Middle School</p>
<p>DL story: I matter! 2 simple words that I was inspired to have my students chant from their heart after hearing Angela Maiers!</p>
<p>I matter! 2 simple words I wanted my students to feel as they lived their passion during Genius Hour.</p>
<p>I matter! 2 simple words that students beamed as they changed the world in their own special way.</p>
<p>Today, as I &#8220;Think Outside The Storm,&#8221; the teacher is called on to share her passion.</p>
<p>My passion is having a profound world changing impact on every student! As I feverishly posted Vine videos and posts showing the enormous power children hold to change the world, I found myself driven with excitement!</p>
<p>As a result of providing my students with the gift of Genius Hour, they tapped their passions and created beautiful change.</p>
<p><a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/delaney.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-658" alt="delaney" src="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/delaney.png" width="468" height="469" /></a></p>
<p>This change opened our hearts to the world, sometimes bringing great joy and other moments heart-breaking hurt.</p>
<p>Students&#8217; bravery is remarkable. Sully resiliently faced bullying and turned to bullied children to befriend them, &#8220;Speaking Life.&#8221; Kamrin rallied her friends and neighbors to collect items sent to Gambia, Africa! Dani, Emma and Jaelissa use their amazing voices to sing &#8220;Beautiful,&#8221; encouraging girls to find their beauty within. Charlotte loves animals so much that she collected and delivered needed items to the Humane Society. Makenzie created crayon dripped art for a hospitalized child and shared the message that anything is possible; believe in yourself! Alexa emotionally moved by a family member&#8217;s breast cancer, raised money to end the disease. Rachel made bracelets and delivered them to sick children at the hospital. Ainsley created homemade cards and gift baskets to deliver to the elderly. My students&#8217; passionate gifts abound! I am humbled by their genius.</p>
<p>As a passionate educator my enthusiasm created possibility. These student actions began with an I wonder question, genuine interest and/or deep passion. The change of one affects many leading to powerful world change.</p>
<p>I believe that the smartest person in the world is the world! It starts with 1 passionate person and grows exponentially to world compassion.</p>
<p>I matter! I am genius! I am genius and the world needs my contribution!</p>
<p>We matter! We are genius! We are genius and together can change the world with our contributions!</p>
<p>Going back to the original questions that led to this blog post, What’s your passion, and what drives it? What’s your heartbreak? How will you use your genius to change the world?</p>
<p>I ask you, have I used my genius to change the world?</p>

<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6752">Launched in Mexico City, the international magazine <a href="http://repentinomagazine.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Repentino</a>. was created by young intellectuals of the American School Foundation for the sole purpose of igniting a love for the arts.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6752"> <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-12-at-9.13.19-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-651" alt="Repentino. cover" src="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-12-at-9.13.19-PM.png" width="394" height="487" /></a></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6752">We publish poetry, essays, short stories and eccentric visual art that shatter the pre-established borders of artistic possibility with a fresh and novel approach. Artists from all backgrounds, from all over the world that have a particular taste for absurdity or an inner desire to express themselves unconventionally are encouraged to submit. Repentino. Magazine is for the sensitive audience with a sharp sense of artistic appreciation.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6774">In publishing Repentino., now reaching the world, students have learned the following: inventing, creating, designing a Gala to promote this publication, and creating organizational documents on Trello, Google Docs, Dropbox, Google Hangouts, and InDesign to move a project-based Initiative forward. In addition, students have created their own Google email attached to the magazine, worked through <a href="https://twitter.com/RepentinoMag">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://repentinomagazine.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ASFMexicoCity?ref=br_tf">Facebook</a> to promote the magazine and continue to get the word out in promoting their magazine.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6774">In helping support <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SmallArtSchool">The Cambodia Small School,</a> The Repentino. magazine hopes to become an advocate of community and world service, branching out the purpose of their campus magazine.  Staff are realizing it takes a village to change the world, and hope to spread the world of what Repentino. has become, and will become, thanks to the many contributors.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6773">The platform is being set to be a social and cultural influence on various cultures, to obtaining a better understanding of the needs of other cultures, through the vehicle of a magazine. This has been stage one, establishing a permanent foundation for the magazine, and phase two will be impacting social change with various cultures once a mass population is familiar with Repentino.; ultimately using ART as the key component of communication through the above-mentioned tools will change the power of these students in the process.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6776">Here is a video we put together for the <a id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6775" href="http://k12onlineconference.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K12 Online Conference</a>, which includes several of our students talking about this project:</p>

<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392231749802_6778">This project brings together student voice, student choice, project based learning, and many other aspects of deeper learning.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(This is a duplicate of the Jan. 30 email sent to registered participants.)</em></p>
<p>Dear DLMOOC  participant,</p>
<p>It’s been a rich week of looking at and thinking about student work, which started with this week’s panel discussion (<a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/live/archives/" target="_blank">now archived if you missed it</a>). Here are some other activities for this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our first “<strong>Lens into the Classroom</strong>” session is today, <strong>Jan. 30 at 4pm Pacific </strong>(Los Angeles). A high school teacher, Brandon Cohen, will be sharing his classroom dilemma about student work. You can read more about <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/the-tiny-house-project/" target="_blank">Brandon’s classroom and dilemma here.</a></li>
<li>If you or one of your students might like to join us on a future Thursday “Lens into the Classroom” session, reply to this email and let us know.</li>
<li>Our <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/put-it-to-practice-week-2-looking-at-student-work/" target="_blank"><strong>Put it Into Practice </strong></a>activity options this week make use of the <a href="http://elschools.org/student-work" target="_blank">EL student work archive </a>mentioned by Ron Berger on this week’s panel.</li>
<li>Please <strong>invite your friends and colleagues to sign up for DLMOOC</strong>. It’s not too late, and we’ve actually designed the course for people to come and go as they like. Email it, post it on FB, tweet it &#8212; <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/" target="_blank">Join DLMOOC</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>We think of DLMOOC as a lot more than readings and panel discussions. In fact, <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/what-is-the-course/" target="_blank">the ways our community interact and construct new meaning together are the core of the course</a>. Thanks for all the great sharing in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/109999014963590178695" target="_blank">DLMOOC G+ community </a>and elsewhere!</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Ben, Rob, Laura, Ryan, Karen, and the whole DLMOOC team</p>

<p>Story title: A Night To Remember</p>
<p>Submitted by: Heather Calabro<br />
Mid-Pacific Institute</p>
<p>DL story: My students studied the World War II internment of Japanese Americans with a focus on the injustice close to home, here in Hawaii. Through an interdisciplinary unit, my students became so engrossed with the topic, that the unit stretched and grew to include a fundraiser, public student work showcase, and commemorative plaque. The story of this deeper learning is best told through the student-created documentary here:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-5c96b3a9-dae3-7666-efae-d3226dad9159">Part of deeper learning is going out and doing something. Each week we will have a suggestion for something you can do on your own and something you can do with others (e.g. students, colleagues). We are trying to keep it simple but will also try to include a sample lesson for group activities. We recognize that we have a wide range of participants across K-16 and beyond so we would love to hear how you are sharing this material in your communities. To that end we hope you share your ideas, lessons, thoughts through Twitter, G+ in small groups or large.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are some ideas for how you might put this week&#8217;s topic of student work into practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>With yourself<br />
Explore the <a href="http://elschools.org/student-work">Expeditionary Learning (EL)</a> student work archive, <a href="http://www.hightechhigh.org/projects/">High Tech High </a>(HTH) student work, or some of your own student work. Pick a piece of work that strikes you, and share with your small group or the larger G+ community.<br />
Questions: What strikes you about the work? How does it reflect deeper learning? What could help this work better reflect deeper learning outcomes?</li>
<li>With a group<br />
Pick a piece or pieces of work from <a href="http://elschools.org/student-work">EL</a>, <a href="http://www.hightechhigh.org/projects/">HTH</a> or from the work of your students and complete a looking at student work <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/hightechhigh.org/document/d/1tVSJlq-dfcJDWJ_4VNTWPuoxS4jCXtvdBR66rIB7pMk/edit">protocol</a> through the lens of deeper learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: You may also choose to print out and use the <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/el-student-work/">six images</a> that were referenced in the Monday panel discussion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(This is a duplicate of the Jan. 26 email sent to registered participants.)</em></p>
<p>Dear DLMOOC community,</p>
<p>We hope you had as much fun last week as we did! And if you’re just joining us, jump right in! DLMOOC is set up so that folks can join in progress and take part in a variety of ways. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by so much goodness, but just dip your toes in a way that’s manageable for you.</p>
<p>This week we’ll be talking about <strong>student work and deeper learning</strong> and taking a look at some of the things going on at Expeditionary Learning (EL) schools. Here are some highlights for the week, and <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/weekly-materials/">a full list of everything can be found here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll be having another great panel discussion this <strong>Monday, Jan. 27 at 4pm Pacific (Los Angeles)</strong>. (Throughout the rest of the course, panel discussions will be on Mondays at this same time, and they will all be archived for later viewing.) This one will feature Ron Berger and others talking about student work.</li>
<li>Our first <strong>“Lens in the Classroom” live event will be held this Thursday, Jan. 30 at 4pm Pacific (Los Angeles)</strong>. In this, you’ll have a “fishbowl” view of a protocol looking at a teacher’s real dilemma of how to think about student work in his classroom.</li>
<li>There are some excellent resources from Ron Berger and EL this week including “<a href="http://www.hightechhigh.org/unboxed/issue1/crafting_beautiful_work/">Crafting Beautiful Work</a>,” “<a href="http://www.edutopia.org/blog/deeper-learning-student-work-ron-berger">Highlighting Student Work</a>,” and the “<a href="https://vimeo.com/38247060">Austin’s Butterfly</a>” video.</li>
<li>You’ll have several chances to reflect on student work yourself, including this week’s <strong>Tweet of the Week</strong> and <strong>Put it Into Practice</strong>.</li>
<li>As always, feel free to alter these activities to meet your own learning needs, and keep up those conversations in your groups and in the broader community.</li>
<li>If you tuned in on Thursday, you know that we had some tech challenges. We are working on addressing server issues but will have a workaround in place for Monday that we hope will enable a successful panel presentation. We will likely not have chat working directly on the site and encourage you to use Twitter for backchannel conversation during the panel conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep those comments, questions, and suggestions coming! That’s how we all learn.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Ben, Rob, Laura, Ryan, Karen, and the whole DLMOOC team</p>
