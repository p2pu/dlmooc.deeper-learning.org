<address>Dear DLMOOC participants:</p>
<p>As we explore <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/weekly-materials/#wk7" data-cke-saved-href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/weekly-materials/#wk7">assessing deeper learning</a> this week, we invite you to share your own experiences with this topic &#8212; How do you assess deeper learning? What assessment is most useful to you and your students? What gets in the way? Share your thoughts <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/109999014963590178695" data-cke-saved-href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/109999014963590178695">on G+</a>, Twitter, or your own blog. (And any of these would be a great submission to get your <a href="http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/323/" data-cke-saved-href="http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/323/">Deeper Learner badge</a> as well!)</p>
<p>And here are some other ways to put DLMOOC into practice for this topic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our tweet of the week: What is the best piece of feedback or assessment that you’ve ever had on your work?<br />
Tweet your response with the hashtags #dlmooc #feedback</li>
<li>Consider how you can <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/pip7/" data-cke-saved-href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/pip7/">transform your assessment questions into deeper learning questions</a>.</li>
<li>Join our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JCwtevxXtM" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JCwtevxXtM">“Lens into the Classroom” session</a> <strong>today at 4pm </strong>Pacific (Los Angeles) where we’ll be talking with Jennifer Pieratt from the New Tech Network about how they use a collaboration rubric.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the High Tech High Graduate School of Education is offering full fellowships in School Leadership and Teacher Leadership, some of which also include a living stipend. Fellows are immersed in a HTH school for a year, while earning their M.Ed. <strong>Priority Deadline March 10 </strong>with rolling admission after this date. Questions can be sent to: hmurugesan@hightechhigh.org. <a href="http://gse.hightechhigh.org/application.php" data-cke-saved-href="http://gse.hightechhigh.org/application.php">More information is available here</a>.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ben, Rob, Laura, Ryan, Karen, and the whole DLMOOC team</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are very excited to announce the availability of two new <strong>deeper learning badges</strong>:<a href="http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/323/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-716" alt="Badge1" src="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Badge1.png" width="200" height="200" /></a><br />
<strong><a href="http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/323/">Deeper Learner</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/324/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-715" alt="Badge2" src="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Badge2.png" width="200" height="200" /></a><br />
<strong><a href="http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/324/">Deeper Learning Guide</a></strong></p>
<p>You can click the links above to apply for these badges. All you have to do is submit a link to some work that shows that you experienced deeper learning through DLMOOC or that shows you helped others experience deeper learning.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve earned a badge, you&#8217;ll be an &#8220;expert&#8221; who can review others&#8217; submissions for the same badge. This is a model that can help connect people and build community. And after you&#8217;ve earned a badge, you can put it into your <a href="http://backpack.openbadges.org/backpack">open badge backpack</a>.</p>
<p>For those interested in more on badges, they are a way to represent and recognize a skill you&#8217;ve learned. <a href="http://openbadges.org/about/">Open badges</a>, like the one&#8217;s we&#8217;ve created here, are not proprietary and are linked to some representation of work you&#8217;ve done (e.g. a blog post or a link to posts you&#8217;ve made in G+) that demonstrates the skill (e.g. deeper learning). In this way, they can be more useful than a transcript or resume, because employers or others can actually see the work that represents your skills.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;d like to experiment with badges in your own learning environment, the <a href="http://badges.p2pu.org/en/">P2PU badge creator</a> makes it easy. I had a great time with some students last summer during which they created their own badges. (<a href="http://www.youthvoices.net/badgessummer2013">More info here</a>.) They started by deciding what skills were really important to document. Then they defined the criteria for earning badges in the areas of their choice. Finally, they submitted and reviewed each others&#8217; work. It was a powerful experience.</p>
