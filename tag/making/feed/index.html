<p>Story title: Recalling school</p>
<p>Submitted by: Ida Brandão</p>
<p>DL story: As a student in an arts school, already as an adult, I recall the importance that the teachers (designated as «masters») always stressed in planning first and doing afterwards.<br />
«Arts of fire» involved pottery making, ceramics painting, moulds and metal working.<br />
Learning by doing was the main methodological approach, but planning and drawing was always the first step.<br />
Whenever one rushes to do things first, without reflecting and planning beforehand, things go wrong.<br />
Even for a simple videocast, it&#8217;s better to plan the storyboard first and record it afterwords , the result turns out better.<br />
The preparation takes longer but one gains time during the process of doing. This structure is important for any learner and should start from early ages.</p>
