<p>Dear DLMOOC community,</p>
<p>We hope you had as much fun last week as we did! And if you’re just joining us, jump right in! DLMOOC is set up so that folks can join in progress and take part in a variety of ways. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by so much goodness, but just dip your toes in a way that’s manageable for you.</p>
<p>This week we’ll be talking about <strong>student work and deeper learning</strong> and taking a look at some of the things going on at Expeditionary Learning (EL) schools. Here are some highlights for the week, and <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/weekly-materials/">a full list of everything can be found here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll be having another great panel discussion this <strong>Monday, Jan. 27 at 4pm Pacific (Los Angeles)</strong>. (Throughout the rest of the course, panel discussions will be on Mondays at this same time, and they will all be archived for later viewing.) This one will feature Ron Berger and others talking about student work.</li>
<li>Our first <strong>“Lens in the Classroom” live event will be held this Thursday, Jan. 30 at 4pm Pacific (Los Angeles)</strong>. In this, you’ll have a “fishbowl” view of a protocol looking at a teacher’s real dilemma of how to think about student work in his classroom.</li>
<li>There are some excellent resources from Ron Berger and EL this week including “<a href="http://www.hightechhigh.org/unboxed/issue1/crafting_beautiful_work/">Crafting Beautiful Work</a>,” “<a href="http://www.edutopia.org/blog/deeper-learning-student-work-ron-berger">Highlighting Student Work</a>,” and the “<a href="https://vimeo.com/38247060">Austin’s Butterfly</a>” video.</li>
<li>You’ll have several chances to reflect on student work yourself, including this week’s <strong>Tweet of the Week</strong> and <strong>Put it Into Practice</strong>.</li>
<li>As always, feel free to alter these activities to meet your own learning needs, and keep up those conversations in your groups and in the broader community.</li>
<li>If you tuned in on Thursday, you know that we had some tech challenges. We are working on addressing server issues but will have a workaround in place for Monday that we hope will enable a successful panel presentation. We will likely not have chat working directly on the site and encourage you to use Twitter for backchannel conversation during the panel conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep those comments, questions, and suggestions coming! That’s how we all learn.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Ben, Rob, Laura, Ryan, Karen, and the whole DLMOOC team</p>
