<p>Story title: Varying feedback</p>
<p>Submitted by: Coral Connor<br />
Northern Beaches Christian School</p>
<p>DL story: Through my involvement in the DLMOOC I have been challenged to rethink what feedback is actually meaningful for the student and conducive to further learning. For years I have marked in pink because red is psychologically damaging according to an article I read years ago.<br />
I now feel an X for a Mathematics solution is equally off putting. I am circling the correct mtie choice response or writing in the final response after circling the first error.<br />
I also used to award half a mark for a response that was not completely correct nor completely incorrect. I thought I was rewarding the student for starting to learn. I noticed the errors didn&#8217;t change so I started to only award a tick for a completely correct response.</p>
