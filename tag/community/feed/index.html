				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often in participating in MOOCs, people wonder “where” or “what” the course is. As one participant said in an email, she felt like someone had organized a surprise party for her, but she hadn’t gotten the invitation.</p>
<p>Most MOOCs have no set time for meeting, no lectures, no required assignments. Instead, it is incumbent on the participants to take part in or even create learning activities that serve their own goals. We think that this can be a very effective learning process, especially for adult learners with rich and diverse previous experiences and goals. However, it can also be daunting and even confounding.</p>
<p>In designing DLMOOC, we thought a lot about this. We intentionally planned the experience as a connectivist MOOCs (cMOOCs), one built on connectivity and flexibility. We didn’t want a course that revolved around required readings or “talking head” lectures. We want a course that lets the participants form connections with others and through those to learn what is useful to them in their practice.</p>
<p>While DLMOOC does have suggestions resources (readings and videos) and weekly panel discussions, we don’t see those as “the course.” Instead, they are optional activities that you can use as jumping off points for your own explorations into deeper learning.</p>
<p>In fact, it is important to us that participants experience deeper learning firsthand in this course. We believe that this is done not by reading or listening, but by doing. In DLMOOC, there are numerous opportunities to do this through sharing in our community, through tweets of the week, through “Put it Into Practice” activities, through taking what you learn in the course back into your own educational environment and trying things out. To us, that is “the course.”</p>
<p>In cMOOCs, it is often said that “the community is the course.” We think we have a pretty special community here. Thank you for being a part of that.</p>
