<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-88067ff7-c6b2-d656-ee0f-606d8892d667">Throughout DLMOOC, we’ve emphasized putting into practice the ideas we’ve talked about. In this final week of DLMOOC, choose one of these activities or make up your own.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">On last week’s panel, Sonya Ramirez suggested these prompts for framing feedback for learning:<br />
<strong>&#8220;Once I thought&#8230;&#8221;</strong><br />
<strong> &#8220;Then I saw&#8230;&#8221;</strong><br />
<strong> &#8220;And now I see&#8230;.&#8221;</strong><br />
Complete these prompts as they relate to your understanding of deeper learning before and after DLMOOC.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Write a post (or make a video or create a poster or make something else) that shows <strong>how DLMOOC has affected your learning</strong> or your learning environment.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Choose a <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/tag/pip/">PIP from a previous week</a> that you didn’t get a chance to do and do it now.</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Share with the world your message about what deeper learning is</strong> and why it’s important. You can express this in text, images, video, a song, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eplaIVoUhmY">spoken word</a> or some other way we haven’t thought of.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Write a <strong>short article about deeper learning</strong> in your own learning environment and submit it to the <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/dl-story-bank-submission/">Deeper Learning Story Bank</a>.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Think about how you might <strong>reuse, remix, or redistribute some of the DLMOOC content</strong>. It’s all open licensed and will be posted indefinitely, so spread the love!</li>
<li dir="ltr">Think about how you’ll <strong>leverage the connections</strong> you’ve made in DLMOOC into the future. Are there people you want to stay in touch with on Twitter or G+? Might you try doing your own Google hangout? Are there <a href="http://cybraryman.com/chats.html">Twitter chats</a> you might join?</li>
<li dir="ltr">Any of the work above would great to submit for a <strong><a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/dl-badges/">DL badge</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We look forward to sharing our reflections on DLMOOC and deeper learning.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(This is a guest post from DLMOOC participant, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/EmmmKat">Emma Scott</a>, </b>Senior Project Officer, Learning Frontiers, Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership.)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LF-logo.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-825" alt="LF logo" src="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LF-logo.png" width="276" height="155" /></a></p>
<p><em>The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) has initiated a project focused on deepening student engagement in learning, supported by the Innovation Unit (UK).</em></p>
<p>We know that education must equip all young people with the knowledge, understanding, skills and values they need to achieve and be successful. But it should also instil the desire, skills and capacities to learn continuously, so every young person can take advantage of opportunities and face today’s (and tomorrow’s) challenges with confidence.<br />
If successful learners are lifelong learners who are involved in and take responsibility for their learning, then our task is to create an education system that ensures all young Australians are deeply engaged in learning – at school, and throughout their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Frontiers</strong> is a collaborative initiative created to transform learning so that every learner succeeds in an education worth having. AITSL&#8217;s vision for Learning Frontiers is that all young Australians emerge from school as curious, creative, confident and engaged lifelong learners.</p>
<p>The project will bring together clusters of schools and other interested parties – ‘design hubs’ – to develop professional practices that increase student engagement in learning, alongside tools and resources to support the scaling and diffusion of new practices outside of the hub.</p>
<p>Design hubs will use a range of methodologies to explore teaching, learning and assessment practices that are built upon four design principles. These principles assert that when learning is highly engaging it is…</p>
<p><a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/graphic.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-824" alt="graphic" src="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/graphic.png" width="866" height="459" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The initiative is</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> A large scale collaborative enquiry</strong>, drawing on the collective wisdom, experience, ambition and imagination of participants to develop professional practice that increases students’ engagement in learning. Teachers themselves will construct the new knowledge the education community needs to move the professional practice of every Australian teacher forward.</li>
<li><strong> High quality professional learning</strong> for participants in and out of design hubs who, as individuals and in groups, are likely to reconfigure their practice – leadership and pedagogic – iteratively and over time as they observe the benefits of students’ increased engagement in learning. Teachers will learn from each other, from experts and others deeply interested in learning that engages learners behaviourally, emotionally and cognitively.</li>
<li><strong> A system level intervention</strong>, explicitly intended to stimulate the growth of new relationships between schools, and between schools and new partners: families, communities, for- and non-profit organisations and public services amongst others. These new arrangements – design hubs – are geared to and formed for the purpose of increasing students’ engagement in learning, for instance by extending learning environments and opportunities beyond the classroom, and for connecting in-school learning with the outside, ‘real world’, of students’ lives.</li>
<li><strong> A scaling and diffusion program</strong>, designed to enable professional practice that increases student engagement in learning to spread beyond the design hub where the practice originates, to benefit students in developer schools; students whose schools are not taking part; and even students who don’t go to school at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, education systems face immense challenges, but the opportunities, tools, and potential partners exceed anything we have encountered in the past. Excellence in professional practice and an education ecosystem that collaborates, learns together and supports each other to expand and develop is our ambitious aspiration.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[This is a guest post from <b>Isaac Jones</b>, the Director of High Tech High North County.]</em></p>
<p>High Tech High North County is a small progressive high school (550 students) in North San Diego. We are part of a larger charter school organization, comprised of 11 schools and 3 campuses.  We have a strong focus on professional development, meeting 2  - 3 times weekly as a full staff.</p>
<div>Over the next semester, we have chosen to identify two themes within the Deeper Learning MOOC that we, as a staff, will study together.  All teachers will sign up for the MOOC and then we will spend a PD cycle (3 sessions) looking in depth at one specific theme.  We will complete this PD cycle for two separate topics.  Teachers will read articles and watch sessions together, identifying specific strategies to incorporate these ideas into their classrooms.  In addition, we will encourage teachers to implement a strategy (and hopefully capture through video) over the course of the PD cycle.</div>

<p>Story title: Real Relationships, Real World Connections</p>
<p>Submitted by: Michelle Sadrena Clark<br />
High Tech High North County</p>
<p>DL story: A deeper learning moment in my life occurred during a two week professional development seminar I participated in this past summer. It took place in New York and was sponsored by the Holocaust Memorial Library. Twenty-six teachers from all over the country were selected to engage in an intensive exploration of Holocaust and Social Justice Education through expert speakers, film analysis, workshops, site visits, discussions, collegial presentations, and writing. We were continually invited to write our reflections after each experience, which truly allowed for deep introspection. The authenticity of the program is what made it meaningful learning. For instance we spent hours with Holocaust survivors listening to their stories, we were able to speak with the only American to remain in Rwanda during the genocide, and learned about Judaism from a local Rabbi before attending a Shabbat service, followed by a traditional Shabbat meal. It was experiential learning at it&#8217;s core! I think what also helped was that every person there was committed and invested in what we were trying to accomplish, understanding of ourselves and others. So in a nutshell, deeper learning has to be real. Real relationships and real world connections are what made this seminar unforgettable.</p>
