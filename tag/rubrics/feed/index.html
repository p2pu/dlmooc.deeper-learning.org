				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">This week&#8217;s &#8220;Lens into the Classroom&#8221; session features Jennifer Pieratt Ph.D., a current School Development Coach for the <a href="http://www.newtechnetwork.org/">New Tech Network</a> of schools. She works with schools in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas at various stages of development including start up, school turnaround and district extension. A former High School humanities teacher at High Tech High North County, Jenny received her PhD in education-her research focused on teacher-student relationships in PBL.</p>
<p>New Tech Network (NTN) works nationwide with schools, districts and communities to develop innovative public schools. They provide services and support that enable schools to fundamentally rethink teaching and learning. Their goal is to enable students to gain the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life, college and the careers of tomorrow. They have 130 + schools and focus on teaching that engages, technology that enables, and school culture that promotes trust, respect, and responsibility.</p>
<p>NTN focus on five school-wide learning outcomes, with corresponding assessments created by SCALE at Stanford, and inspired by Envision. They are (see example rubrics below):</p>
<ul>
<li>Oral communication</li>
<li>Written communication</li>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Knowledge and Thinking</li>
<li>Agency</li>
</ul>
<p>Jenny’s question is:</p>
<p><strong>How can I leverage the NTN collaboration rubric to help promote deeper learning in teacher’s classrooms?</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few of NTN&#8217;s collaboration rubrics:</p>
<ul>
