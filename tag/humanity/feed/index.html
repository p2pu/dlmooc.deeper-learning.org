<p>Story title: Being Human</p>
<p>Submitted by: Syd DiChiara<br />
Nex+Gen Academy</p>
<p>DL story: We began the year in our 10th grade Humanities class by asking the question, what is unique about being human?</p>
<p>Students were immersed in all kinds of media; short stories, documentaries, essays, art, &amp; poetry.</p>
<p>One of the stories we read and discussed was Ursula LeGuin&#8217;s &#8220;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas,&#8221; a deeply open-ended short story that challenged students to think about a number of philosophical questions, none of which had an easy answer. Students ended the project with a collaborative art installment that conveyed their group&#8217;s ideas on what it means to be human.</p>
<p>It was a great start to the year because students were engaged with complex ideas and with one another in a way that set a tone for the rest of the year. Months later, in their end-of-semester reflections, many chose the &#8220;Being Human&#8221; project as the one that impacted them the most as thinkers and learners.</p>
