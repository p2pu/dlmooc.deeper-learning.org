		<description><![CDATA[Hi Monica!

Thank you so much for sharing this beautiful DL story!

As I was reading your piece, I was reminded of a quote from J.D. Salinger&#039;s &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;:

&quot;Seymour once said to me - in a crosstown bus, of all places - that all legitimate religious study must lead to unlearning the differences, the illusory differences, between boys and girls, animals and stones, day and night, heat and cold.&quot;

Although this quote is in direct reference to religion and spirituality, I always see a connection to the notion of &quot;unlearning the differences&quot; and our students (I teach 12th grade) dwindling sense of wonder and creativity.  What are the &quot;differences&quot; that our students see and how do those &quot;differences&quot; keep them from diving freely into their own sense of wonder and creativity?

Also, I LOVED the bridge you built between creativity and grit.  Forget it&#039;s relevance to our students...that&#039;s a great reminder for me in my own existence!

Thanks again for sharing!]]></description>
