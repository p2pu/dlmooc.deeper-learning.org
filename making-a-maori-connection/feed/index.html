		<description><![CDATA[Very often students are limited by adult control. We tend to replicate what we were instructed, it&#039;s embedded in us to think that youngsters need much more guidance than they do. 
When there&#039;s a natural curiosity and interest, it&#039;s better to give freedom and let them choose their path and work out the solutions.
Stephen Heppell has many interesting interventions and videos, this one is from 2009 - Future Learning (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JTc9HeTh1A)

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m struck by how your students knew to reach out and found out how to do it. You&#039;re right. That&#039;s a rich learning experience and shows how connected the world has become. And kudos to that person in New Zealand, too. I bet those kids won&#039;t ever forget the experience (and may well write their own story in some future Deep Learning Story Bank)
