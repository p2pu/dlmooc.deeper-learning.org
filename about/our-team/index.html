He had spent the previous 3 years at Point Loma High School, teaching math and coaching the men&#8217;s rugby team. He earned and cleared his math credential through the San Diego Unified School District Intern/BTSA Program. Prior to teaching, Mr. Torres practiced law in Chicago and New York City. As a lawyer, he worked pro bono coaching the moot court and mock trial teams for a Bronx charter school that primarily serves socioeconomically disadvantaged students. This experience inspired him to leave law and pursue teaching.</p>
