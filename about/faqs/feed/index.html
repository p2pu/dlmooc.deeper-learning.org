		<description><![CDATA[Most of the course activities can be done whenever you like. There will be two live sessions a week, but they will also be recorded so you can watch later. See http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/how-does-this-dlmooc-thing-work/ for more on how the course will work.

We will have some discussions on adult learners, though the focus will be more on youth. However, many of the readings and videos will be applicable to adult learners, and there are others enrolled in the course who are interested in adult learners. We encourage folks to form small groups to explore topics of specific interest to them.

If you decide to participate, make sure to sign up on the main page so you get our weekly emails. 

DLMOOC is flexible, and we hope you&#039;ll participate in whatever way makes sense for you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m interested in taking this class. I couldn&#039;t find the times. Can I participate whenever? Is it recorded? Or do I need to be on line at a certain time?

I&#039;m an adult ESL instructor. Will there be some discussions about helping adult learners learn how to learn in and out of class?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] K-16 educators can sign up for a free MOOC (massive open online course) to learn how to put deeper learning—which essentially means covering a smaller number of topics in a greater depth—into practice. According to the Hewlitt Foundation, which is one of the supporters of this project, students feel more motivated and challenged in classrooms where deeper learning is the focus and can see how their school work relates to real life. The course will run for nine consecutive weeks, from January 20 through March 27, 2014. Currently, more than 1,300 participants from 66 countries have signed up (39 percent of participants are from outside the United States). To learn more, click here. [&#8230;]]]></description>
