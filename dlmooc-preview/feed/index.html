		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your question, Eric. The event will start at 4pm Pacific/7pm Eastern. (There was a bug in G+ around the events scheduled before the time change; we apologize for the confusion.)

You can watch both events live (or the archives later) at http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/live/ (and yes, we&#039;ll be there a few minutes early). See you Monday!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am looking forward to the G+ event on Monday and I want to confirm that for those of us on the East Coast, the event will open up at 6pm.  If so, will the Hangout open up a few minutes early?  Thanks!
